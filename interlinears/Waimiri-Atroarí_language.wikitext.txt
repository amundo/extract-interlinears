The '''Waimiri Atroari language''' is spoken by the [[Waimiri-Atroari|Waimiri Atroari people]]. The current population is 2,009 (PWA, 2018),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Waimiri_Atroari#Language|title=Waimiri Atroari - Indigenous Peoples in Brazil|website=pib.socioambiental.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> and they have 19 villages spread along the rivers of [[Camanaú River|Camanau/Curiau]], Alalaii, [[Jauaperi River|Jauaperi]], and [[Branquinho River|Rio Branquinho]] (Bruno 2003, 12).<ref name=":0" /> These are located in the northern part of the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|State of Amazonas]], and the southern part of the [[Roraima|State of Roraima]] (Bruno 2003, 10).<ref name=":0" /> The people call themselves Kinja and call their language, Kinja Iara (meaning “people’s language”) (Do Vale).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Waimiri_Atroari#Language|title=Waimirir Atraori|last=Do Vale|first=Maria Carmen|website=pib.socioambiental.org}}</ref> The language has many other names such as, Atroahy, Atroahí, Atroarí, Atroaí, Atrowari, Atruahi, Atruahí, Ki'nya, Krishaná, Waimirí, Waimirí-atroarí, Yawaperí (Glottolog).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/waim1253|title=Waimiri-Atroari|website=Glottolog 3.3|access-date=28 Sep 2018}}</ref> This language seems to have a high transmission as it is spoken by all members of the community and is the main language used for reading and writing (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" />

== Contact ==
First contact with the Waimiri Atroari occurred in the 17th century with the Spanish and Portuguese crown spreading to gain more territory (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" />  First official contact with the Waimiri Atroari took place in 1884 with Joãno Barbosa Rodrigues who enlisted the Waimiri Atroari as guides. At this point in time the Waimiri Atroari already had a reputation for being violent and Rodrigues sought to change the stereotypes associated with the group(Do Vale).<ref name=":1" />

In 1911 a member of the [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|SPI (Indian Protection Services)]] made contact with the Waimiri Atroari, the following year the First Indian Attraction Station was established (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> Despite friendly contact the government of this region saw the great wealth of resources that the native land possessed and encouraged the invasion of the land in order to exploit the natural resources (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> As a result, the Waimiri Atroari took up defense of their land with bows and arrows. This led to many acts of violence between the Waimiri Atroari and non-indigenous people, with military forces used to combat the indigenous group and wiping out entire villages (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> The next large scale conflict with the Waimiri Atroari that has been documented is in the 1960s with the Amazonas State and Roraima Territory Government's plan for a highway between [[Manaus]] and [[Caracaraí|Caracarai]], cutting directly through indigenous land (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> This project brought in individuals and teams to “pacify” the Waimiri Atroari as well as Military forces to build the highway and intimidate the indigenous people (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> As a result of high tension and disagreements most of the non-indigenous pacifists were killed by the Waimiri Atroari (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" />

In 1971 the [[Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory|Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Reservation]] was created, however between plans for Amazonas expansion and the discovery of cassiterite deposits, the government continued to infringe on the land (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> The reserve was demoted to a Temporary Restricted Area for the Attraction and Pacification of the Waimiri Atroari Indians in 1981 in order to exclude the mineral deposits from their land (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" /> Later more land was taken from the Waimiri Atroari as a hydroelectric plant project flooded over 30,000 hectares of their land (Do Vale). Today the Waimiri Atroari have their own school system which they control independently (Do Vale).<ref name=":1" />

== Language Family ==
Waimiri Atroari belongs to the [[Cariban languages|Carib language family]], which is centralized in [[Northern South America]]. The Carib languages in [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]] are fairly similar, while Waimiri-Atroari is rather different (Moore, 2006, 119).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=D.|date=3 April 2008|title=Brazil: Language Situation|journal=The encyclopaedia of language and linguistics|pages=117–128}}</ref> Carib can be categorized into three groups: Northwest Amazon, Guiana area and Upper Xingu Basin. Waimiri Atroari seems to fall into the second group, Guiana area (Bruno 2003, 16).<ref name=":0" />

== Documentation ==
[[João Barbosa Rodrigues]]’ wordlist seems to be the first to document the language in 1885 and he refers to the people as “Crichanas” (Bruno 2003, 12).<ref name=":0" /> A century later, in 1985, a phonological proposal and alphabet were developed by a Catholic missionary couple from the Indigenous Missionary Council (Bruno 2010, 85).<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Bruno|first=Ana Carla|date=2010|title=Lessons from Waimiri Atraori Syllable Structure|journal=LIAMES|volume=10|pages=85–99}}</ref> A year after, in 1986, another missionary couple from the Evangelical Mission of the Amazonian (MEVA), created a more accurate orthography (Bruno 2010, 86).<ref name=":2" />

It seems that the first detailed description was done by Ana Carla Bruno. She released a dissertation in 2003 on the descriptive grammar of the Waimiri-Atroari language. She extensively described the [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]], and [[syntax]] of the language. In addition, she has continued detailing the [[Typology (linguistics)|typology]] of Waimiri-Atroari in further works. In 2004, she published a paper on [[reduplication]] in the language. The following two years, she detailed its [[Pronominal|pronominal system]] (2005)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruno|first=Ana Carla|date=2005|title=Reduplicacao em Waimiri Atraori|journal=Amerindia|volume=especial sobre linguas Carib, no. 28|pages=88–94}}</ref> and [[causative]] construction (2006).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruno|first=Ana Carla|date=2006|title=The Causative Construction in Waimiri Atraori|journal=LIAMES|volume=6|pages=101–108}}</ref> Then, in 2008 and 2009, she further analyzed the syntactic features of [[Grammatical case|case-marking]]; [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]], [[clause]]s and [[word order]]. Most recently, she explored the value of linguistic analysis to better [[language revitalization]] by analyzing the [[Syllable|syllable structure]] in the [[orthography]] and formal education of Waimiri-Atroari (2010).<ref name=":2" />

== Projects ==
While there are currently no language documentation projects for Wairmiri Atroari, there are projects for other languages in the Carib family. Carib language documentation supported by [[DOBES]] include the following languages: [[Kuikuro language|Kuikuro]], documented by Bruna Franchetto, as well as [[Kaxuiana language|Kaxuyana]] and [[Bakairi language|Bakairi]], which have been documented by [[Sérgio Meira|Sergio Meira]] (Báez et al., 2016, 32).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Documentation and Revitalization in Latin American Contexts: Latin American Contexts|last=Báez|first=Gabriela Pérez, Chris Rogers, and Jorge Emilio Rosés Labrada, eds|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2016}}</ref>

== Morphology ==
Bruno (2003) creates a thorough documentation of the morphology of Waimiri Atroari which includes nouns of possession, relational morphemes, [[Morphological derivation|derivational]] morphemes, [[pronoun]]s, non-third person pronouns and third-person pronouns. Verbs have also been documented, covering [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense/aspect suffixes, mood]] ([[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and negation suffix), interrogative clitic, interrogative forms, [[causative]] forms and [[Desiderative mood|desiderative]] suffix. Waimiri Atroari also has documentation of [[adverb]]s, [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Grammatical case|case markings]] (Bruno 2003).<ref name=":0" />

=== Pronouns ===
Bruno states that pronouns can take both subject and object positions in Waimiri Atroari (76).<ref name=":0" />

==== 1st Person: ''awy, aa, kara~kra'' ====

===== Subject position  =====
Bruno states that ''kara~kra'' is used when responding to a question or to emphasize that the person did an action or wants something. It is also the only pronoun that can be used in the OSV order (77).<ref name=":0" />

=== Negation particle ===
Waimiri Atroari uses non-verbal negation, that is, negation marked by particles ''kap~kapy~kapa'' and ''wan.'' These particles act to indicate negation rather than negation being marked on a verb and are often used to negate existence as seen below (Bruno 115).

{{interlinear|number=(25)
|aiana ram wyty '''kapa'''
|Sp.bird 2PART meat/food NEG
|‘Any-preto is not food.’}}

{{interlinear|number=(26)
|wyty '''wan''' naminja
|Meat NEG dog
|“Don’t eat the food, dog!’}}

=== Causative forms ===
There are two kinds of causative forms that can be used to signify if a subject causes an event. First, there is the ''-py'' morpheme that indicates if someone “made” someone else do something or if they are not resistant to “cause” an event to happen. There is one construction where the morpheme -''py'' appears with the lexicalized verb, such as in examples (27) and (28), where -''py'' attaches to the verb for ‘tell’ (Bruno 100).

{{interlinear|number=(27)
|Aa Kaina h-ary'''-py'''-pia kyrywu ini-se.
|1.PRO Kaina 1s-tell-CAUS-IM.P snake {see-in order to}
|'I told/dictated to Kaina to see the snake.'}}

{{interlinear|number=(28)
|Paruwe aa-iry'''-py'''-pia woky yry-ky Marta inaka
|Paruwe 1o-tell-CAUS-IM.P banana give-IMP Marta DAT
|'Paruwe told/dictated to me to give the banana to Marta.'}}

There is also a form where -''py'' doesn't appear with a lexicalized verb, such as in examples (29) and (30), where -''py'' attaches to the verbs ‘bleed’ and ‘laugh’. It also seems that intransitive verbs like these, behave like transitive verbs when they take a causative form like V[Intr+Caus [A O]] (Bruno 101).

{{interlinear|number=(29)
|kyka ram ka hu-myny-tah'''-py'''-pia.
|1+2.PRO 2PART 3.PRO 1+2A-bleed-VERBL-CAUS-IM.P
|'We made him bleed.'}}

{{interlinear|number=(30)
|Ka k-yeepitxah'''-py'''-pia.
|3.PRO 1+2o-laugh-CAUS-IM.P
|'She/he made us laugh.'}}

Second, there is a form that indicates if the subject is “letting” the event happen. Someone is ordered or permitted to do something without forcing the other or knowing if the other may fulfill the event. It seems that there is an absence of the morpheme -''py'', as in examples (31) and (32), and the particle ''tre’me'' is notable, however Bruno notes that the particle ''tre’me'' may not mean “let” because of example (33), in which it does not indicate “let/permit” (Bruno 103).

{{interlinear|number=(31)
|Aa wo'nj-e'me h-aminjaky-piany a-wenpa-typah '''tre'me''' tyruwa kapry pyky.

== Syntax ==

=== Split System-S ===
Waimiri Atroari is  what Gildea (1998)<ref>Gildea, Spike. “''On Reconstructing Grammar: Comparative Cariban Morphosyntax''.” Oxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics, vol. 18, Oxford: Oxford Press (1998).</ref> classifies to as an Inverse Split system-S. Characteristics of this language system include A and O nominals having no case marking, a lack of auxiliaries and personal prefix set as well as the collective number suffixes (Bruno 2015, 5). In Inverse Split System-s, also referred to as Set I systems the OV unit may either precede or follow the A, in Wamiri Atroari the order is AOV (Bruno 2015, 7).<ref name=":3">Bruno, Ana Carla. ''"Case Marking in Waimiri Atroari: typical nominative/accusative or nominative with some inverse/split-s features.''" Revista Linguíʃtica 4.2 (2015)<br /></ref>

A Verb-Phrase may be formed with just the verb (Bruno 2015, 7)<ref name=":3" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|Ka-ky!
|speak-IMPER
|"Speak!"}}

A verb may be preceded by an Noun-Phrase (Bruno 2015, 8).<ref name=":3" />

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|bahinja maia '''kɨnk-E'''
|Children knife break-TAM
|"The children break the knife."}}

The particle ''ram'' cannot separate elements of a single phrase, however it can be used as a tool to determine which element is moved within a sentence (Bruno 2015, 8).<ref name=":3" />

{{interlinear|number=(3)a.
|tahkome '''i-inɨ-pia''' ram Irikwa

|‘Irika (a mythological entity) ate the elders.’}}

{{interlinear|number=b.
|*[tahkome ram i-inɨ-pia] Irikwa
|elders 2PART REL-eat-IMD.PAST Irikwa}}

In OSV contexts the object may move independently to subject position rather than the Verb-Phrase preceding the Noun-Phrase through the process of topicalization in which its components cannot be separated (Bruno 2015, 8).<ref name=":3" />

{{interlinear|number=(4)

|‘I drink the banana juice’}}

=== Hierarchy ===
Hierarchical relationships exist in Waimiri Atroari in which  the third person is ranked lower than the first, second and first plural inclusive and exclusive person. ''' ''' In situations where second person acts on first person, or first person acts on second person there is may be subject agreement or object agreement. Therefore, it is necessary that subject and object marking follow a hierarchy : 1=2, 1+2/1+3>3. The following table provided by Bruno (2015, 11)<ref name=":3" /> illustrates how case is marked in Waimiri Atroari as well as the hierarchy present in the language. <br />

=== Quantification ===

====  Adverbial quantifiers ====
Noun phrases which possess quantifiers show positional variation, as seen in examples (5) to (9). Adverbials quantifiers may be positioned on either side of the head noun. Bruno (2003)<ref name=":0" /> explains the relative mobility of these quantifiers by categorizing them as adjuncts.
