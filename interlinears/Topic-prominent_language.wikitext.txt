A '''topic-prominent language''' is a language that organizes its [[syntax]] to emphasize the [[topic–comment]] structure of the sentence. The term is best known in American linguistics from Charles N. Li and [[Sandra Thompson (linguist)|Sandra Thompson]], who distinguished '''topic-prominent''' languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], from subject-prominent languages, such as [[English language|English]].

In Li and Thompson's (1976) view, topic-prominent languages have morphology or syntax that highlights the distinction between the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and the comment (what is said about the topic). Topic–comment structure may be independent of the [[word order|syntactic ordering]] of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]] and [[object (grammar)|object]].

==Common features==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2009}}
Many topic-prominent languages share several syntactic features that have arisen because the languages have sentences that are structured around topics, rather than subjects and objects:

*They tend to downplay the role of the [[grammatical voice|passive voice]], if a passive construction exists at all, since the main idea of passivization is to turn an object into a subject in languages whose subject is understood to be the topic by default.
*They rarely have expletives or "dummy subjects" ([[dummy pronoun|pleonastic pronoun]]s) like English ''it'' in ''It's raining''.
*They often have sentences with so-called "double subjects", actually a topic plus a subject. For example, the following sentence patterns are common in topic-prominent languages:

::[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]
{{fs interlinear|indent=4|italics2=no|italics3=yes
|這個 人 個子 很 高。|c1=(traditional)
|这个 人 个子 很 高。|c2=(simplified)
|zhège rén gèzi hěn gāo
|"This person ''(topic)'' height ''(subject)'' very tall."}}

::[[Japanese language|Japanese]]
{{fs interlinear|indent=4
|その ヤシは 葉っぱが 大きい。
|sono yashi-wa happa-ga ookii
|"That palm tree ''(topic)'' leaves ''(subject)'' are big."}}

*They do not have [[article (grammar)|articles]], which are another way of indicating old vs. new information.
*The distinction between subject and object is not reliably marked.

The Lolo–Burmese language [[Lisu language|Lisu]] has been described as highly topic-prominent,<ref name="Li & Thompson">{{cite book |last1 = Li|first1 = Charles N.|last2 = Thompson|first2 = Sandra A.|chapter = Subject and Topic: A New Typology of Language|title = Subject and Topic|editor = Charles N.

===Mandarin Chinese===
{{fs interlinear|indent=3
| 張三 我 已經 見過 了。
| {Zhāng Sān} wǒ yǐjing jiàn-guò le
| {Zhang San} I already see-EXP RES
| (As for) Zhang San, I've seen (him) already.}}

{{fs interlinear|indent=3
|top= Usual order*:
| 我 已經 見過 張三 了。
| wǒ yǐjing jiàn-guò {Zhāng Sān} le
| I already see-EXP {Zhang San} RES
| I've already seen Zhang San.}}

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Remark: Mandarin Chinese sentences are predominantly [[subject-verb-object|SVO]], but the language allows the object to be promoted to the topic of the sentence, resulting in an apparently [[object-subject-verb|OSV]] word order.

===Japanese===
{{fs interlinear|indent=3
| 魚は 鯛が おいしい。
| sakana-wa tai-ga oishi-i
| fish-TOP red.snapper-NOM delicious-NPST
| When it comes to fish, red snapper is delicious. / Red snapper is a delicious fish.}}

| You tomorrow again I'll see. → I'll see you again tomorrow.}}

===American Sign Language ===

In [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), the topic of the sentence, that is the focus of the sentence, is put at the beginning.  For example, in translating the English phrase "We are going to the store tomorrow", some possible ASL sentences, literally translated, could be:
*"WE GO STORE TOMORROW."
*"TOMORROW, STORE WE GO." (Topicalization, TOMORROW is the focus) 
*"*STORE, WE GO TOMORROW." (Topicalization, STORE is the focus)

Proper ASL structure, though, uses the time indicator first, so the proper ASL form would be the second one:  "TOMORROW, STORE WE GO."
