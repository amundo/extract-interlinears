The '''Urartian''' or '''Vannic''' language was spoken by the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of [[Urartu]], located in the region of [[Lake Van]], with its capital near the site of the modern town of [[Van, Turkey|Van]], in the modern-day Armenian Highlands area of [[Turkey]].<ref>People of Ancient Assyria: Their Inscriptions and Correspondence - Page 89 by Jørgen Laessøe</ref> Its prevalence is unknown.

First attested in the 9th century [[BCE]], Urartian ceased to be written after the fall of the Urartian state in 585 BCE, and presumably it became extinct due to the fall of Urartu.<ref>Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008.

==Classification==
{{main|Hurro-Urartian languages}}

Urartian was an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative]], [[agglutinative language]], which belongs to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian family]], whose only other known member is [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]].<ref>The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East - Page 292 by Eric M. Meyers, American Schools of Oriental Research</ref>  It survives in many inscriptions found in the area of the Urartu kingdom, written in the [[Assyria]]n [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]].
There have been claims<ref>Jeffrey J. Klein, Urartian Hieroglyphic Inscriptions from Altintepe, Anatolian Studies, Vol. 24,   (1974), 77-94</ref> of a separate autochthonous script of "Urartian hieroglyphs" but they remain unsubstantiated.

Urartian is closely related to Hurrian, a somewhat better documented language attested for an earlier, non-overlapping period, approximately from 2000 BCE to 1200 BCE (written by native speakers until about 1350 BCE). The two languages must have developed quite independently from approximately 2000 BCE onwards.<ref>Wilhelm 1982: 5</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Gernot |year=2008 |chapter=Urartian |editor-last=Woodard |editor-first=Roger D. |title=The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientlanguages00wood_436 |url-access=limited |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientlanguages00wood_436/page/n127 105]–123 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Although Urartian is not a direct continuation of any of the attested dialects of Hurrian,<ref>Academic American Encyclopedia - Page 198</ref> many of its features are best explained as innovative developments with respect to Hurrian as it is known from the preceding millennium. The closeness holds especially true of the so-called Old Hurrian dialect, known above all from Hurro-Hittite bilingual texts.

The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a [[Hurro-Urartian languages#classification|genetic relationship to other language families]] (e.g. [[Northeast Caucasian languages]], [[Indo European languages]], or [[Kartvelian languages]]), but none of these are generally accepted.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Gernot |year=2008 |chapter=Hurrian |editor-last=Woodard |editor-first=Roger D. |title=The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientlanguages00wood |url-access=limited |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientlanguages00wood/page/n103 81]–104 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

Indo-European (namely [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], as well as [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and possibly [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]]) etymologies have been proposed for many Urartian personal and topographic names, such as the names of kings [[Aramu|Arame]] and [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti]], regions such as [[Diauehi]] and [[Gegharkunik Province|Uelikulqi]], cities such as [[Arzashkun]], geographical features like [[Murad Su|the Arșania River]], as well as some Urartian vocabulary and grammar.<ref>Ivanov, Vyacheslav V.

==Decipherment==
The German scholar [[Friedrich Eduard Schulz]], who discovered the Urartian inscriptions of the Lake Van region in 1826, made copies of several [[cuneiform]] inscriptions at [[Tushpa]], but made no attempt at decipherment.<ref name=noonan/>

Schulz's drawings, published posthumously only in 1840 in the ''Journal Asiatique'',<ref>Schulz, Fr. Ed., "Mémoire sur le lac du Van et ses environs, ''Journal Asiatique'' ser. 3 vol. 9 (1840): 257-323 + 8 plates.</ref> were crucial in forwarding the decipherment of Mesopotamian cuneiform by Edward Hincks.<ref>Hincks, Edward. "On the Inscriptions at Van." ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' 9 (1847): 387-449.</ref>

After the decipherment of [[Assyrian cuneiform]] in the 1850s, Schulz's drawings became the basis of deciphering the Urartian language. It soon became clear that it was unrelated to any known language, and attempts at decipherment based on known languages of the region failed.<ref name=goetze/> The script was finally deciphered in 1882 by [[A. H. Sayce]]. The oldest of these  inscriptions is from the time of [[Sarduri I]] of Urartu, whose title was 'King of the Four Quarters'.<ref name=noonan>John Noonan, ''[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197302/van..htm Van!]'' at saudiaramcoworld.com</ref>

Decipherment only made progress after [[World War I]], with the discovery of Urartian-Assyrian bilingual inscriptions at [[Kelashin Stele|Kelišin]] and [[Topzawä]].<ref name=goetze>A. Götze 1930, 1935</ref><ref>J. Friedrich 1933</ref>

In 1963, a grammar of Urartian was published by [[Giorgi Melikishvili|G. A. Melikishvili]] in [[Russian language|Russian]], appearing in [[German language|German]] translation in 1971. In the 1970s, the genetic relation with Hurrian was established by  [[I. M. Diakonoff]].

[[Image:Urartian language stone, Erebuni museum 3.jpg|thumb|Urartian cuneiform [[stele|stone inscription]] on display at the Erebuni Museum in [[Yerevan]]. The inscription reads: ''For the God [[Khaldi (god)|Khaldi]], the lord, [[Argishtis I of Urartu|Argishti]], son of [[Menuas of Urartu|Menua]], built this temple and this mighty fortress. I proclaimed it Irbuni (Erebuni) for the glory of the countries of Biai (=Urartu) and for holding the Lului (=enemy) countries in awe. By the greatness of God Khaldi, this is Argishti, son of Menua, the mighty king, the king of the countries of Biai, ruler of the city of Tushpa'']]

The oldest recorded texts originate from the reign of [[Sarduri I]], from the late 9th century BCE.<ref>Urartu - Page 65 by Boris Borisovich Piotrovskiĭ</ref> Texts were produced until the fall of the realm of Urartu approximately 200 years later.

Approximately two hundred inscriptions written in the Urartian language, which adopted and modified the cuneiform script, have been discovered to date.<ref>The international standard Bible encyclopedia - Page 234 by Geoffrey William Bromiley</ref>

==Writing==

=== Cuneiform ===
Urartian cuneiform is a standardized simplification of Neo-Assyrian cuneiform.
Unlike in Assyrian, each sign only expresses a single sound value.
The sign  ''gi'' {{cuneiform|𒄀}} has the special function of expressing a hiatus, e.g. ''u-gi-iš-ti'' for ''Uīšdi''. A variant script with non-overlapping wedges was in use for rock inscriptions.

===Hieroglyphs===
Urartian was also rarely written in the "[[Anatolian hieroglyphs]]" used for the [[Luwian language]]. Evidence for this is restricted to [[Altıntepe]].

There are suggestions that besides the Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions, Urartu also had a native hieroglyphic script.
The inscription corpus is too sparse to substantiate the hypothesis. It remains unclear whether the symbols in question form a coherent writing system, or represent just a multiplicity of uncoordinated expressions of [[proto-writing]] or ad-hoc drawings.<ref>Paul Zimansky, Urartian Material Culture As State Assemblage: An Anomaly in the Archaeology of Empire. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 299/300, The Archaeology of Empire in Ancient Anatolia (Aug. - Nov., 1995), pp. 103-115</ref>
What can be identified with a certain confidence are two symbols or "hieroglyphs" found on vessels, representing certain units of measurement:  [[Image:Hieroglyph Urartian aqarqi.jpg|100x33px]] for ''aqarqi'' and [[Image:Hieroglyph Urartian tyerusi.jpg|100x33px]] for ''ṭerusi''. This is known because some vessels were labelled both in cuneiform and with these symbols.<ref>Mirjo Salvini: ''Geschichte und Kultur der Urartäer''. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1995. {{ISBN|3-534-01870-2}}</ref>

==Phonology==

Urartian had at least the following consonants, conventionally transcribed below:

Labial stops: p, b<br>
Dental stops: t, d, ṭ<br>
Velar stops: k, g, q<br>
Sibilants: s, z, ṣ, š<br>
Gutturals: {{IPA|ʔ}}, ḫ<br>
Sonorants: m, n, l, r

There were presumably also the semivowels /w/ and /j/.

As usual with ancient languages, the exact nature and pronunciation of the consonants are uncertain. As the table shows, the stops and the sibilants all display a three-way distinction between voiced, voiceless and "emphatic" consonants, but it cannot be ascertained what was special about the third groups of consonants, which were rendered with the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform signs for the Semitic emphatics. Perhaps they were [[glottalization|glottalized]] or [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]. The pronunciation of the sibilants is debatable, as it is for Akkadian; some may actually have been [[affricate]]s.

The script distinguishes the vowels ''a'', ''e'', ''i'' and ''u''. It is unclear whether there was an /o/ as well. There may have been phonemic vowel length, but it is not consistently expressed in the script. Word-finally, the distinction between ''e'' and ''i'' is not maintained, so many scholars transcribe the graphically vacillating vowel as a [[schwa]]: ''ə'', while some preserve a non-reduced vowel (usually opting for ''i''). The full form of the vowel appears when suffixes are added to the word and the vowel is no longer in the last syllable: ''Argištə'' "[[Argišti]]" - ''Argištešə'' "by Argišti ([[ergative case]])". This [[vowel reduction]] also suggests that stress was commonly on the next-to-the-last syllable.

In the [[morphonology]], various morpheme combinations trigger [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]: *''ar-it-u-mə'' → ''artumə'', *''zaditumə'' → ''zatumə'', *''ebani-ne-lə'' → ''ebanelə'', *''turul(e)yə'' →'' tul(e)yə''.

==Morphology==

===Nominal morphology===

The morphemes which may occur in a noun follow a strict order: stem - article - possessive suffix - number and case suffix - suffixes received through [[Suffixaufnahme]].

All nouns appear to end in a so-called thematic vowel - most frequently ''-i'' or ''-e'', but ''-a'' and ''-u'' also occur. They may also end in a derivational suffix. Notable derivational suffixes are ''-ḫə'', forming adjectives of belonging (e.g. ''Abiliane-ḫə'' "of the tribe Abiliani", ''Argište-ḫə'' "son of [[Argišti]]") and ''-šə'', forming abstract nouns (e.g. ''alsui-šə'' "greatness", ''ardi-šə'' "order", ''arniu-šə'' "deed").

The forms of the so-called "article" are ''-nə'' (non-reduced form ''-ne-'') for the singular, ''-ne-lə'' for the plural in the [[absolutive case]] and ''-na-'' for the other forms of the plural. They are referred to as "[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] suffixes" and can be compared to [[definite article]]s, although their use does not always seem to match that description exactly. They also obligatorily precede agreement suffixes added through Suffixaufnahme: e.g. ''Argište-šə Menua-ḫi-ne-šə'' "Argišti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)". The plural form can also serve as a general plural marker in non-absolutive cases: ''arniuši-na-nə'' "by the deeds".<ref>Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.112</ref>

The well-attested possessive suffixes are the ones of the first person singular ''-ukə'' (in non-reduced form sometimes ''-uka-'') and ''-i(yə)'' (in non-reduced form sometimes ''-iya-''): e.g.  ''ebani-uka-nə'' "from my country", ''ebani-yə'' "his country".

The plural is expressed, above all, through the use of the plural "article" (''-ne-lə'' in the absolutive case, ''-na-'' preceding the case suffix in the oblique cases), but some of the case suffixes also differ in form between the singular and the plural. Therefore, separate plural version of the case suffixes are indicated below separately. The nature of the absolutive and ergative cases is as in other ergative languages (more details in the section ''Syntax'' below).

[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]]: sing. ''-Ø'', plur. ''-lə''<br>
[[Ergative case|Ergative]]: ''-š(ə)''<br>
[[Genitive]]: sing. ''-i'', plur. ''-wə''<br>
[[Dative]]: sing. ''-ə'', plur. ''-wə''<br>
[[Directive case|Directive]]: sing. ''-edə'', plur. (archaic) ''-š-tə''<br>
[[Comitative]]: ''-ranə''<br>
[[Ablative]]-[[Instrumental case|instrumental]]: ''-nə''<br>
[[Ablative]]: sing. ''-danə'', plur. ''-š-tanə''<br>
[[Locative]]: ''-a''

Since the "complete" plural forms also include the plural definite article, they appear as ''-ne-lə'', ''-na-šə'', ''-na-wə'', ''na-(e)də'' or ''na-š-tə'', etc..

A phenomenon typical of Urartian is [[Suffixaufnahme]] - a process in which dependent modifiers of a noun (including [[genitive case]] modifiers) agree with the head noun by absorbing its case suffixes. The copied suffixes must be preceded by the article (also agreeing in number with the head). Examples: ''Ḫaldi-i-na-wə šešti-na-wə'' "for the gates (dative) of [god] Ḫaldi (dative)", ''Argište-šə Menua-ḫi-ne-šə'' "Argišti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)".

The known personal pronouns are those of the first and third person singular.<br>
The first person singular has two different forms for the absolutive case: ''ištidə'' as the absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, and ''šukə'' as the absolutive object of a transitive verb. The ergative form is ''iešə''. Judging from correspondences with Hurrian, ''šu-'' should be the base for the "regular" case forms. An enclitic dative case suffix for the first person singular is attested as ''-mə''.<br>
The third person singular has the absolutive form ''manə''.<br>
As for possessive pronouns, besides the possessive suffixes (1st singular ''-uka-'' and 3rd singular ''-iya'') that were adduced above, Urartian also makes use of possessive adjectives formed with the suffix ''-(u)sə'': 1st singular ''šusə'', 3rd singular ''masə''.

The encoding of pronominal ergative and absolutive participants in a verb action is treated in the section on ''Verbal morphology'' below.

Demonstrative pronouns are ''i-nə'' (plural base ''i-'', followed by article and case forms) and ''ina-nə'' (plural base ''ina-'', followed by article and case forms). A relative pronoun is ''alə''.

===Verbal morphology===

The paradigm of the verb is only partially known. As with the noun, the morphemes that a verb may contain come in a certain sequence that can be formalized as a "verb chain": root - root complements (of unclear meaning) - [[ergative case|ergative]] third person plural suffix -  [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] markers ([[intransitive]]/[[transitive verb|transitive]]) - other person suffixes (expressing mostly the [[absolutive case|absolutive]] subject/object). It is not clear if and how tense or aspect were signalled.

The valency markers are ''-a-'' (rarely ''-i-'') for intransitivity and ''-u-'' for transitivity: for example ''nun-a-də'' "I came" vs ''šidišt-u-nə'' "he built". A verb that is usually transitive can be converted to intransitivity with the suffix ''-ul-'' before the intransitive valency marker: ''aš-ul-a-bə'' "was occupied" (vs ''aš-u-bə'' "I put in [a garrison]").<ref>Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.115</ref>

The person suffixes express the persons of the absolutive subject/object and the ergative subject. When both of these are present, a single suffix may expresses a unique combination of persons. The ascertained endings are as follows (the ellipsis marks the place of the valency vowel):

<u>Intransitive verbs:</u><br>
1st person singular: ''-də''<br>
3rd person singular: ''-bə''<br>
3rd person plural: ''-lə''<br>
<u>Transitive verbs:</u><br>
1st person singular (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): ''-bə''<br>
1st person singular (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): ''-bə'' / ''-lə''<br>
3rd person singular (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): ''-nə'' <br>
3rd person singular (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): ''-a-lə''<br>
3rd person plural (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): ''-it-…-nə'' <br>
3rd person plural (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): ''-it-…-lə''

Examples: ''ušt-a-də'' "I marched forth"; ''nun-a-bə'' "he came"; ''aš-u-bə'' "I put-it in"; ''šidišt-u-nə'' "he built-it"; ''ar-u-mə'' "he gave [it] to me", ''kuy-it-u-nə'' "they dedicated-it".

As the paradigm shows, the person suffixes added after the valency vowel express mostly the person of ''absolutive'' subject/object, both in intransitive and in transitive verbs. However, the picture is complicated by the fact that the absolutive third person singular is expressed by a different suffix depending on whether the ergative subject is in the first or third person. An additional detail is that when the first-person singular dative suffix ''-mə'' is added, the third-person singular absolutive suffix ''-nə'' is dropped. The encoding of the person of the absolutive subject/object is present, even though it is also explicitly mentioned in the sentence: e.g. ''argište-šə inə arə šu-nə'' "Argišti established(-it) this granary". An exceptional verb is ''man-'' "to be", in that it has a transitive valency vowel, and takes no absolutive suffix for the third person singular: ''man-u'' "it was" vs ''man-u-lə'' "they were".

The [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed by the addition of the suffix ''-ə'' to the root: e.g. ''ar-ə'' "give!". The [[jussive]] or third person imperative is formed by the addition of the suffix ''-in'' in the slot of the valency vowel, whereas the persons are marked in the usual way, following an epenthetic vowel ''-[i]-'':e.g. ''ar-in-[i]-nə'' "may he give it", ''ḫa-it-in-nə'' "may they take it". The modal suffix ''-l-'', added between the valency vowel and the person suffixes, participates in the construction of several modal forms. An [[optative]] form, also regularly used in clauses introduced with ''ašə'' "when", is constructed by ''-l-'' followed by ''-ə'' (''-i'' in non-reduced form) - the following absolutive person suffix is optional, and the ergative subject is apparently not signalled at all: e.g. ''qapqar-u-l-i-nə'' "I wanted to besiege-it [the city]", ''urp-u-l-i-nə'' or ''urp-u-l-ə'' "he shall slaughter". A [[Conditional mood|conditional]] is expressed by a graphically similar form, which is, however, interpreted by Wilhelm (2008) as ''-l-'' followed by ''-(e)yə'':<ref>Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.118</ref> an example of its use is ''alu-šə tu-l-(e)yə'' "whoever destroys it". Finally, a [[desiderative]], which may express the wish of either the speaker or the agent, is expressed by ''-l-'' followed by a suffix ''-anə''; in addition, the valency marker is replaced by ''-i-'': e.g. ''ard-i-l-anə'' "I want him to give …", ''ḫa-i-l-anə'' "it wants to take/conquer …".

Negation is expressed by the particle ''ui'', preceding the verb. A prohibitative particle, also preceding the verb, is ''mi''. ''mi'' is also the conjunction "but", whereas ''e'ə'' is "and (also)", and ''unə'' is "or".

[[Participle]]s from intransitive verbs are formed with the suffix ''-urə'', added to the root, and have an active meaning (e.g. ''ušt-u-rə'' "who has marched forth"). Participles from transitive verbs are formed with the suffix ''-aurə'', and have a passive meaning (e.g. ''šidaurə'' "which is built"). It is possible that ''-umə'' is the ending of an infinitive or a verb noun, although that is not entirely clear.

==Syntax==

Urartian is an ergative language, meaning that the [[grammatical subject|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb]] and the [[direct object|object]] of a [[transitive verb]] are expressed identically, with the so-called [[absolutive case]], whereas  the subject of a transitive verb is expressed with a special [[ergative case]]. Examples are: ''Argištə nun-a-bi'' "Argišti came" vs ''Argište-šə arə šu-nə'' "Argišti established a granary". Within the limited number of known forms, no [[split ergativity|exceptions from the ergative pattern]] are known.

The word order is usually verb-final, and, more specifically, [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (where S refers to the ergative agent), but the rule is not rigid and components are occasionally re-arranged for expressive purposes. For example, names of gods are often placed first, even though they are in oblique cases: ''Ḫaldi-ə ewri-ə inə E<sub>2</sub> Argište-šə Menuaḫini-šə šidišt-u-nə'' "For Ḫaldi the lord Argišti, son of Menua, built this temple." Verbs can be placed sentence-initially in vivid narratives: ''ušt-a-də Mana-idə ebanə at-u-bə'' "Forth I marched towards Mana, and I consumed the land."<ref>Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.120</ref> Nominal modifiers usually follow their heads (''erelə tarayə'' "great king"), but deictic pronouns such as ''inə'' precede them, and genitives may either precede or follow them. Urartian generally uses [[postposition]]s (e.g. ''ed(i)-i-nə'' "for", ''ed(i)-i-a'' - both originally case forms of ''edi'' "person, body" - ''pei'' "under", etc..) which govern certain cases (often ablative-instrumental). There is only one attested preposition, ''parə'' "to(wards)". Subordinate clauses are introduced by particles such as ''iu'' "when", ''ašə'' "when", ''alə'' "that which".

==Shared lexicon with Armenian==

Diakonoff (1985) and Greppin (1991) present etymologies of several Old Armenian words as having a possible Hurro-Urartian origin. Contemporary linguists, such as [[Hrach Martirosyan]], have rejected many of the Hurro-Urartian origins for these words and instead suggest native Armenian etymologies, leaving the possibility that these words may have been loaned into Hurro-Urartian from Armenian, and not vice versa.<ref>Hrach K. Martirosyan. ''Etymological Dictionary of the Armenian Inherited Lexicon.'' Brill. 2009.</ref>

*''[[wikt:ագարակ|agarak]]'' "field" from Hurrian ''awari'' "field" (however, alternate theories suggest that this is an Armenian word from Proto-Indo-European [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%82%C3%A9%C7%B5ros ''h₂éǵros''] or a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] loan);
*''[[wikt:աղախին|ałaxin]]'' "slave girl" from Hurrian ''al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne'';
*''[[wikt:արծիւ|arciw]]'' "eagle" from Urartian ''Arṣiba'', a proper name with a presumed meaning of "eagle" (more recent scholarship suggests that this is an Armenian word from Proto-Indo-European ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%AE%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%AB#Old_Armenian *h₂r̥ǵipyós]'' which was loaned into Urartian<ref>Calvert Watkins. ''How to Kill A Dragon in Indo-European''. Oxford University Press. 1995.</ref>);
*''[[wikt:արտ|art]]'' "field" from Hurrian ''arde'' "town" (rejected by Diakonoff and Fournet);
*''[[wikt:աստեմ|astem]]'' "to reveal one's ancestry" from Hurrian ''ašti'' "woman, wife";
*''[[wikt:ծառ|caṙ]]'' "tree" from Urartian ''ṣârə'' "garden" (an alternate etymology suggests that this is an Armenian word from  Proto-Indo-European [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%AE%D5%A1%D5%BC ''*ǵr̥so'']);
*''[[wikt:ծով|cov]]'' "sea" from Urartian ''ṣûǝ'' "(inland) sea" (an alternate theory suggests that this comes from a Proto-Indo-European [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%AE%D5%B8%D5%BE#Old_Armenian root]);
*''[[wikt:կուտ|kut]]'' "grain" from Hurrian ''kade'' "barley" (rejected by Diakonoff; closer to Greek ''kodomeýs'' "barley-roaster");
*''[[wikt:մախր|maxr]]'' ~ ''[[wikt:մարխ|marx]]'' "pine" from Hurrian ''māḫri'' "fir, juniper";
*''[[wikt:պեղեմ|pełem]]'' "dig, excavate" from Urartian ''pile'' "canal", Hurrian ''pilli'' (rejected by Diakonoff, others have suggested an origin stemming from Proto-Indo-European *bel- (“to dig, cut off?”);
*''[[wikt:սալոր|salor]]'' ~ ''[[wikt:շլոր|šlor]]'' "plum" from Hurrian *''s̄all-orə'' or Urartian *''šaluri'' (cf. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''šallūru'' "plum");
*''[[wikt:սան|san]]'' "kettle" from Urartian ''sane'' "kettle, pot";
*''[[wikt:սուր|sur]]'' "sword", from Urartian ''šure'' "sword", Hurrian ''šawri'' "weapon, spear" (considered doubtful by Diakonoff, contemporary linguists believe this is an Armenian word from the Proto-Indo-European root ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%BD%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80#Old_Armenian *ḱeh₃ro-]'', meaning "sharp");
*''[[wikt:տարմաջուր|tarma-ǰur]]'' "spring water" from Hurrian ''tarman(l)i'' "spring" (an alternate etymology suggests that at least ǰur has an Armenian etymology from Proto-Indo-European [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%BB%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80#Old_Armenian *yuHr- or gʷʰdyōro-]);
*''[[wikt:ուղտ|ułt]]'' "camel" from Hurrian ''uḷtu'' "camel";
*''[[wikt:խարխարել|xarxarel]]'' "to destroy" from Urartian ''harhar-š-'' "to destroy";
*''[[wikt:խնձոր|xnjor]]'' "apple" from Hurrian ''ḫinzuri'' "apple" (itself from Akkadian ''hašhūru'', ''šahšūru'').
Arnaud Fournet, Hrach Martirosyan, and Armen Petrosyan propose additional borrowed words of Armenian origin loaned into Urartian and vice versa, including grammatical words and parts of speech, such as Urartian "eue" ("and"), attested in the earliest Urartian texts and likely a loan from Armenian (compare to Armenian "yev" (և, եվ), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%81epi *h₁epi]''). Other loans from Armenian into Urartian includes personal names, toponyms, and names of deities.<ref>Archív Orientalni. 2013.
