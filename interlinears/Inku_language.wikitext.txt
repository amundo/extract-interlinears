'''Inku''' was an [[Indo-Aryan language]] formerly spoken throughout [[Languages of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] by four of the country's [[Peripatetic groups of Afghanistan|itinerant communities]]: the Jalali, the Pikraj, the Shadibaz and the Vangawala. Itinerant communities in Afghanistan, whether Inku-speaking or not, are locally known as "Jats" (not to be confused with the [[Jat people|Jats of India and Pakistan]]), a term which is not a self-designation of the groups but rather a collective, often pejorative name given by outsiders.{{sfn|Hanifi|2012}} It is presumably for this reason that the language is called '''Jakati''' in the [[Ethnologue]] encyclopedia.

Each of the four groups speaks a variety with slight differences compared to the others.{{sfn|Rao|1995|p=82}} According to their local tradition, their ancestors migrated in the 19th century from the [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]] and [[Dera Ghazi Khan District|Dera Ghazi Khan]] regions of present-day Pakistan.{{sfn|Rao|1986|p=266}} Such an origin suggests that Inku may be related to the [[Saraiki language]] spoken there,{{sfn|Rao|1986|p=267}} though nothing is conclusively known.{{sfn|Rao|1995}} 

The total population of the four Inku-speaking groups was estimated to be 7,000 as of the end of the 1970s.{{sfn|Rao|1986|pp=267–71}} There is no reliable information about their present state, though it is unlikely that many have survived the subsequent upheavals in the country,{{sfn|Hanifi|2012}} and [[Ethnologue]] states, though without citing a source, that Inku's last speakers "probably survived into the 1990s".{{sfn|Eberhard|Simons|Fennig|2019}}

Linguistic materials about the varieties spoken by the Shadibaz, Vangawala and Pikraj were collected by [[Aparna Rao]] in the 1970s, but they have not been published or analysed yet.{{sfn|Rao|1995|p=82}}
