'''Martuthunira''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal language]], that was the traditional language of the [[Martuthunira people]] of [[Western Australia]].

The last fluent speaker of Martuthunira, [[Algy Paterson]], died on 6 August 1995. From 1980 he worked with the linguist [[Alan Dench]] to preserve Martuthunira in writing, and it is from their work that most of our knowledge of Martuthunira today comes.

==Name==
The name ''Martuthunira'', pronounced {{IPA|[maɽʊðʊneɻa]}} by native speakers, means "those who live around the [[Fortescue River]]". It has many spelling variants, including: '''Maratunia''', '''Mardadhunira''', '''Mardathon''', '''Mardathoni''', '''Mardathoonera''', '''Mardatuna''', '''Mardatunera''', '''Mardudhoonera''', '''Mardudhunera''', '''Mardudhunira''', '''Mardudjungara''', '''Marduduna''', '''Mardudunera''', '''Marduthunira''', '''Mardutunera''', '''Mardutunira''', '''Marduyunira''', '''Martuthinya''', and '''Martuyhunira'''.

==Classification==
Martuthunira is classified as a member of the [[Ngayarta languages|Ngayarta]] branch of the [[Pama–Nyungan languages]]. Under [[Carl Georg von Brandenstein]]'s 1967 classification, Martuthunira was classed as a Coastal Ngayarda language, but the separation of the Ngayarda languages into Coastal and Inland groups is no longer considered valid.
==Phonology==
Martuthunira has a fairly standard Australian [[phonology]]. [[R. M. W. Dixon]] uses it as a prototypical example in his 2002 book ''Australian Languages: Their nature and development''.

The laterals—but perhaps uniquely not the nasals—are allophonically [[prestopped consonant|prestopped]].<ref>Jeff Mielke, 2008. ''The emergence of distinctive features'', p 135</ref>

The laminal stop {{IPA|/c/}} has a voiced [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ɟ]}} between vowels.

Between vowels, the dental stop {{IPA|/t̪/}} can become {{IPA|[d̪]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, {{IPA|[ð̞]}}, {{IPA|[ɻ]}}, {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[w]}}, or even simply a syllable break. In some words one particular realization is always used, in others there is [[free variation]].

The alveolar stop {{IPA|/t/}} has a voiced allophone {{IPA|[d]}} after a nasal. It occurs between vowels only in a handful of words, probably all [[loanword]]s, where it has a longer period of closure than the other stops {{IPA|[tː]}}.

The retroflex stop {{IPA|/ʈ/}} has a voiced allophone {{IPA|[ɖ]}} after a nasal, and a flapped allophone {{IPA|[ɽ]}} between vowels.

Besides the voiced allophones mentioned above, stops are usually voiceless and [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]].

The laterals have [[prestopped]] allophones {{IPA|[ᶜʎ ᵗ̪l̪ ᵗl <sup>ʈ</sup>ɭ]}} when they occur in a [[syllable coda]].

The alveolar rhotic {{IPA|/r/}} is a tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, and a usually voiceless trill {{IPA|[r̥]}} finally.

The palatal semivowel {{IPA|/j/}} may be dropped initially before {{IPA|/i/}}, but the equivalent dropping of {{IPA|/w/}} before initial {{IPA|/u/}} is rare.

===Vowels===

| {{IPA|i iː}}
| {{IPA|u uː}}
|- style="text-align: center;"
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
|colspan=2| {{IPA|a aː}}
|}
{{IPA|/i/}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, though it may be realized as {{IPA|[i]}} near palatal consonants and as {{IPA|[e]}} near {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}.

{{IPA|/iː/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɪː]}} in morpheme-initial syllables, {{IPA|[eː]}} elsewhere.

{{IPA|/u/}} is usually realized as {{IPA|[u]}} in stressed syllables, and {{IPA|[ʊ]}} in unstressed syllables. {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to varying degrees when near laminal consonants, being most fronted {{IPA|[ʉ]}} when preceded by a dental consonant. It has an unrounded allophone {{IPA|[ɨ]}} when followed by {{IPA|/ɻ/}}.

{{IPA|/uː/}} is usually {{IPA|[ʊː]}}, but is lowered to {{IPA|[ɔː]}} when preceded by a dental consonant.

{{IPA|/a/}} is usually {{IPA|[ɐ]}} when stressed, {{IPA|[ə]}} when unstressed. Following a laminal consonant, more so after dentals than palatals, it is fronted towards {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. When preceded by {{IPA|/w/}} and followed by a velar consonant, it is realized as {{IPA|[ɒ]}}.

{{IPA|/aː/}} is usually simply {{IPA|[ɐː]}}.

===Phonotactics===
All Martuthunira words begin with one of the following consonants, from most to least frequent: {{IPA|/p k m w ŋ c t̪ j ɲ n̪/}}. This consists of only peripheral and laminal stops, nasals, and semivowels. Words may end in a vowel, or one of {{IPA|/n r l ɲ ɳ ʎ ɭ/}}.

==Grammar==

===Accusative alignment===
[[Image:Accusative alignment.svg|thumb|right|Accusative alignment. A = [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a transitive verb; S = [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an intransitive verb; O = [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb.]]
Unlike most Australian languages, which exhibit [[ergativity]], Martuthunira and the other [[Ngayarta languages]] have an [[nominative–accusative language|accusative]] alignment. That is, the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] of [[transitive verb]]s are treated the same as the subjects of [[intransitive verb]]s, while the [[object (grammar)|objects]] are treated differently.

The Martuthunira [[nominative case]] is unmarked ([[zero morpheme|zero]]). The [[accusative case]], which descends from a suffix that originally marked the [[dative case]], takes the form {{IPA|/-ŋu/}} on [[proper noun|proper nominals]]; {{IPA|/-ku/}} on [[common noun|common nominals]] ending in a nasal ({{IPA|/ɲ n ɳ/}}); {{IPA|/-ju/}} on common nominals ending in a lateral or a rhotic ({{IPA|/ʎ l ɭ r/}}); and vowel lengthening for common nominals ending in vowels. The accusative case is identical to the [[genitive case]], except for common nominals ending in vowels, where the genitive suffix is {{IPA|/-wu/}}.

===Case stacking===
Martuthunira exhibits [[case stacking]], where nouns take multiple [[declension|case]] suffixes for [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]. For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=PROP:proprietive case
|Ngayu nhawulha ngurnu tharnta-{{blue|a}} mirtily-{{red|marta}}-{{blue|a}} thara-{{purple|ngka}}-{{red|marta}}-{{blue|a}}.
|I saw that euro-{{blue|ACC}} joey-{{red|PROP}}-{{blue|ACC}} pouch-{{purple|LOC}}-{{red|PROP}}-{{blue|ACC}}
|I saw that [[wallaroo|euro]] with a joey in its pouch.}}

*''Tharnta'' is the [[object (linguistics)|object]] of the verb, and so is in the [[accusative case]].
*''Mirtily'' gets a [[proprietive case|proprietive]] suffix, which indicates that it is possessed by the euro. However, because it modifies {{transl|vma|tharnta}}, it additionally gets an accusative suffix to agree with it.
*''Thara'' gets a [[locative case|locative]] suffix, which indicates that it is what the joey is in. It also gets a proprietive suffix to agree with {{transl|vma|mirtily}}, and then an accusative suffix to agree with {{transl|vma|tharnta}}.
