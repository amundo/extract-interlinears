'''Malagasy''' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|l|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|s|i}};<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> {{IPA-mg|maləˈɡasʲ|language}}) is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language and the national language of [[Madagascar]]. Malagasy is the westernmost [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]], brought to Madagascar by the settlement of Austronesian peoples from the [[Sunda islands]] around the 5th century AD. The Malagasy language is one of the [[Barito languages]] and is most closely related to the [[Ma'anyan language]], still spoken on [[Borneo]] to this day. Malagasy also includes numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords, from the time of the early Austronesian settlement and trading between Madagascar and the Sunda Islands.<ref name="Dahl1951"/> After c. 1000 AD, Malagasy incorporated numerous [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, brought over by new settlers and traders.

Malagasy is spoken by around 25 million people in Madagascar and the [[Comoros]]. Most people in Madagascar speak it as a first language, as do some people of [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] descent elsewhere. Malagasy is divided between two main dialect groups; Eastern and Western. The central plateau of the island, where the capital [[Antananarivo]] and the old heartland of the [[Merina Kingdom]] is located, speaks the Merina dialect. The Merina dialect is the basis of Standard Malagasy, which is used by the government and media in Madagascar. Standard Malagasy is one of two official languages of Madagascar alongside French, in the 2010 constitution of the Fourth Republic of Madagascar.

Malagasy is written in the [[Latin script]] introduced by Western missionaries in the early 19th century. Previously, the [[Sorabe]] script was used, a local development of the [[Arabic script]].

==Classification==
The Malagasy language is the westernmost member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian branch]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]],<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1767-16 Malagasy's family tree on Ethnologue]</ref> a grouping that includes languages from [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]]. In fact, Malagasy's relation with other Austronesian languages had already been noted by early scholars, such as the Dutch scholar [[Adriaan Reland]] in 1708.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blench |first=Roger |date=2007 |title=New Palaeozoogeographical Evidence for the Settlement of Madagascar |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology%20data/Indian%20Ocean/Blench%20final%20Azania%202007.pdf |journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1080/00672700709480451 |s2cid=59022942 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180146/http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology%20data/Indian%20Ocean/Blench%20final%20Azania%202007.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Relandus |first=Hadrianus |title=Dissertationum Miscellanearum, Pars Tertia et Ultima |date=1708 |publisher=Gulielmi Broedelet |location=Trajecti ad Rhenum |pages=137–138 |language=la |quote=Haec omnia satis evincunt (quod in initio hujus dissertationis monuimus) longe lateque diffundi usum linguae Malaïcae, quae non tantum in Chersoneso Malaeorum & insulis Sumatra, Java, Bomeo, Moluccis sed & aliis magis ad orientem sitis usurpatur. Quibus cum si conferamus illud quod linguae Insulae Madagascar plurima vocabula Malaïca sint permixta, magis adhuc stupebimus linguam unam, qualis Malaïca est, vestigia sua reliquisse in tam dissitis terrarum spatiis qualia sunt insula Madagascar ad litus Africae & insula Cocos in mari inter Asiam & Americam interjecto. Lubet hic laterculum addere vocum Madagascaricarum, ut dicta nostra confirmemus. |author-link=Adriaan Reland}}</ref>

Among all Austronesian languages, Dahl (1951) demonstrated that Malagasy and [[Ma'anyan language|Ma'anyan]] – an [[East Barito language]] spoken in [[Central Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]] on the island of [[Borneo]] – were particularly closely related.<ref>{{Citation |last=Dahl |first=Otto Christian |title=Malgache et Maanyan: Une comparaison linguistique |date=1951 |publisher=Egede Instituttet |language=fr |location=Oslo |series=Avhandlinger utgitt av Instituttet 3}}</ref> The language also has apparent influence from early [[Old Malay]]. Furthermore, there appears to be a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence or substratum in Malagasy [[phonotactics]] (Dahl 1988).

Later, Adelaar (1995) suggested that the vocabulary of Malagasy also contains many words that are of [[South Sulawesi]] origin.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Adelaar |first=Alexander |year=1995 |title=Asian Roots of the Malagasy: A Linguistic Perspective |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=325–356 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003036 |jstor=27864676 |doi-access=free |language=en}}</ref> Further evidence for this suggestion was presented by [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2018).<ref>{{Citation |last=Blench |first=Roger |title=Interdisciplinary Approaches to Stratifying the Peopling of Madagascar |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Austronesian/Malagasy/Stratification%20in%20the%20settlement%20of%20Madagascar%202018.pdf |year=2018 |language=en |via=www.rogerblench.info}}</ref>

== Etymology==
Malagasy is the [[demonym]] of [[Madagascar]], from which it is taken to refer to the people of Madagascar in addition to their language.

==Geographic distribution==
Malagasy is the principal language spoken on the island of Madagascar. It is also spoken by Malagasy communities on neighboring Indian Ocean islands such as [[Réunion]], [[Mayotte]] and [[Mauritius]]. Expatriate Malagasy communities speaking the language also exist in Europe and North America, including, to a lesser extent, in [[Belgium]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]].

==Legal status==
The Merina dialect of Malagasy is considered the national language of Madagascar. It is one of two official languages alongside French in the 2010 constitution put in place the Fourth Republic. Previously, under the 2007 constitution, Malagasy was one of three official languages alongside French and English. Malagasy is the language of instruction in all public schools through grade five for all subjects, and remains the language of instruction through high school for the subjects of history and Malagasy language.

==Dialects==
[[File:Map of Malagasy language dialects.svg|thumb|368x368px|Map of the Malagasy dialects on Madagascar]]
There are two principal dialects of Malagasy; Eastern (including [[Merina]]) and Western (including [[Sakalava]]), with the [[isogloss]] running down the spine of the island, the south being western, and the central plateau and much of the north (apart from the very tip) being eastern. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' encodes 12 variants of Malagasy as distinct languages. They have about a 70% [[Lexical similarity|similarity in lexicon]] with the Merina dialect.

=== Eastern Malagasy ===
The Eastern dialects are:
* Northern Betsimisaraka Malagasy (1,270,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] on the northeastern coast of the island
* Southern Betsimisaraka Malagasy (2,000,000 speakers) – spoken by the Betsimisaraka in the North of the region Vatovavy Fito Vinany.
* Plateau Malagasy (10,893,000 speakers) – spoken in the centre of the island and includes southeastern dialects like Antemoro and Antefasy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10346/MA |title=Antanosy in Madagascar |website=Joshua Project}}</ref>
* Tanosy Malagasy (639,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Antanosy people]] in the south of the island
* Tesaka Malagasy (1,130,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Antaisaka people]] in the southeast of the island.<ref name=":0" />

=== Western Malagasy ===
The Western dialects are:
* Antankarana Malagasy (156,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Antankarana]] in the northern tip of the island
* Bara Malagasy (724,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Bara people]] in the south of the island
* Masikoro Malagasy (550,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Masikoro]] in the southwest of the island
* Sakalava Malagasy (1,210,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Sakalava people]] on the western coast of the island
* Tandroy-Mahafaly Malagasy (1,300,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Antandroy]] and the [[Mahafaly|Mahafaly people]] on the southern tip of the island
* Tsimihety Malagasy (1,615,000 speakers) – spoken by the [[Tsimihety people]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/MG/languages|title=Madagascar|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref>
Additionally, [[Bushi language|Bushi]] (41,700 speakers) is spoken on the [[French overseas territory]] of [[Mayotte]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/buc/20|title=Bushi|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref> which is part of the [[Comoro Islands|Comoro island chain]] situated northwest of Madagascar.

===Region specific variations===
The two main dialects of Malagasy are easily distinguished by several phonological features.

Sakalava lost final nasal consonants, whereas Merina added a voiceless {{IPA|[ə̥]}}: 
* *tañan 'hand' → Sakalava {{IPA|[ˈtaŋa]}} ''**tan̈a'', Merina {{IPA|[ˈtananə̥]}} ''tanana''

Final *t became {{IPA|-[tse]}} in the one but {{IPA|-[ʈʂə̥]}} in the other: 
* *kulit 'skin' → Sakalava {{IPA|[ˈhulitse]}} ''**holitse'', Merina {{IPA|[ˈhudiʈʂə̥]}} ''hoditra''

Sakalava retains ancestral *li and *ti, whereas in Merina these become {{IPA|[di]}} (as in ''huditra'' 'skin' above) and {{IPA|[tsi]}}:
* *putiq 'white' → Sakalava {{IPA|[ˈfuti]}} ''**foty'', Merina {{IPA|[ˈfutsi]}} ''fotsy''
However, these last changes started in Borneo before the Malagasy arrived in Madagascar.

== Writing system ==

[[File:Book of Mormon - Malagasy.jpg|thumb|Malagasy version of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', in Latin script with the letter ''ô'']]
The language has a written literature going back presumably to the 15th century. When the French established [[Tôlanaro|Fort-Dauphin]] in the 17th century, they found an Arabico-Malagasy script in use, known as [[Sorabe alphabet|Sorabe]] ("large writings"). This Arabic [[Ajami script]] was mainly used for astrological and magical texts. The oldest known manuscript in that script is a short Malagasy-Dutch vocabulary from the early 17th century, which was first published in 1908 by Gabriel Ferrand<ref>Ferrand, Gabriel (1908). "Un vocabulaire malgache-hollandais." ''Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indië'' 61.673-677. The manuscript is now in the Arabico-Malagasy collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].</ref> though the script must have been introduced into the southeast area of Madagascar in the 15th century.<ref name="Ferrand, Gabriel 1905" />

The first bilingual renderings of religious texts are those by [[Étienne de Flacourt]],<ref>Flacourt, Étienne de (1657). ''Le Petit Catéchisme madécasse-français''.Paris;(1661). ''Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar''.Paris, pp.197–202.</ref> who also published the first dictionary of the language.<ref>Flacourt, Étienne de (1658). ''Dictionnaire de la langue de Madagascar''. Paris.</ref> [[Radama I]], the first literate representative of the [[History of Madagascar#The Merina monarchy|Merina monarchy]], though extensively versed in the Arabico-Malagasy tradition,<ref>Berthier, H.J. (1934). ''De l'usage de l'arabico=malgache en Imérina au début du XIXe siècle: Le cahier d'écriture de Radama Ier''. Tananarive.</ref> opted in 1823 for a Latin system derived by [[David Jones (missionary)|David Jones]] and invited the Protestant [[London Missionary Society]] to establish schools and churches. The first book to be printed in Malagasy using [[Latin script|Latin characters]] was the [[Bible]], which was translated into Malagasy in 1835 by British Protestant [[missionaries]] working in the highlands area of Madagascar.<ref>The translation is due to David Griffith of the [[London Missionary Society]], with corrections in 1865–1866.{{cite web|url=http://www.haisoratra.org/breve.php3?id_breve%3D529 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072223/http://www.haisoratra.org/breve.php3?id_breve=529 |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref>

The current Malagasy alphabet consists of 21 letters: ''a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, v, y, z.'' The [[orthography]] maps rather straightforwardly to the phonemic inventory. The letters ''i'' and ''y'' both represent the {{IPA|/i/}} sound (''y'' is used word-finally, and ''i'' elsewhere), while ''o'' is pronounced {{IPA|/u/}}. The affricates {{IPA|/ʈʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ɖʐ/}} are written ''tr'' and ''dr'', respectively, while {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/dz/}} are written ''ts'' and ''j''. The letter ''h'' is often silent. All other letters have essentially their IPA values. The letters ''c, q, u, w'' and ''x'' are all not used in native Malagasy words.

''Mp'' and occasionally ''nt'' may begin a word, but they are pronounced {{IPA|/p, t/}}.

''@'' is used informally as a short form for ''amin'ny'', which is a preposition followed by the definite form, meaning for instance ''with the''.

=== Diacritics ===
[[Diacritic]]s are not obligatory in standard Malagasy, except in the case where its absence leads to an ambiguity: ''tanàna'' ("city") must have the diacritic to discriminate itself from ''tanana'' ("hand"). They may however be used in the following ways:
*◌̀ ([[grave accent]]) shows the stressed syllable in a word. It is frequently used for disambiguation. For instance in ''tanàna'' (town) and ''tanana'' (hand), where the word that is an exception to the usual pronunciation rules (''tanàna'') gets an accent. Using the accent on the word that follows the pronunciation rules (''tànana'') is less common, mainly in dictionaries.{{Clarify|reason=Is using such accents less common in dictionaries, or is using such accents not uncommon in dictionaries and less common in general? If the latter is the case, I would expect: "Using the accent on the word that follows the pronunciation rules (tànana) is less common, but it does occur, mainly in dictionaries." The current wording states that using the accent is less common in dictionaries (among other texts).|date=October 2021}} (This is very similar to the usage of the grave accent in [[Italian language|Italian]].)
*◌́ ([[acute accent]]) may be used in
**very old dictionaries, along with grave accent
**dialects such as Bara
**French (''Tuléar'') and French-spelled (''Antsirabé'') names. Malagasy versions are ''Toliara'' or ''Toliary'' and ''Antsirabe''.
*◌̂ ([[circumflex]]) is used as follows:
**''ô'' shows that the letter is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}} and not {{IPA|/u/}}, in Malagasified foreign words (''hôpitaly'') and dialects (''Tôlan̈aro''). In standard Malagasy, ''ao'' or ''oa'' (as in ''mivoaka'') is used instead.
**sometimes the single-letter words ''a'' and ''e'' are written ''â'' and ''ê'' but it does not change the pronunciation
*◌̈ ([[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) is used with ''n̈'' in dialects for a velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. Examples are place names such as ''Tôlan̈aro'', ''Antsiran̈ana'', ''Iharan̈a'', ''Anantson̈o''. This can be seen in maps from FTM, the national institute of geodesy and cartography.
*◌̃ ([[tilde]]) is used in ''ñ'' sometimes, perhaps when the writer cannot produce an ''n̈'' (although ''ng'' is also used in such cases). In Ellis' Bara dialect dictionary, it is used for [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as well as [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.

After a stressed syllable, as at the end of most words and in the final two syllables of some, {{IPA|/a, u, i/}} are reduced to {{IPA|[ə, ʷ, ʲ]}}. ({{IPA|/i/}} is spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in such cases, though in monosyllabic words like ''ny'' and ''vy'', {{angle bracket|y}} is pronounced as a full {{IPA|[i]}}.) Final {{IPA|/a/}}, and sometimes final syllables, are devoiced [[pausa|at the end of an utterance]]. {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are never reduced or devoiced. The large number of reduced vowels, and their effect on neighbouring consonants, give Malagasy a phonological quality not unlike that of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

{{IPA|/o/}} is marginal in Merina dialect, found in interjections and loan words, though it is also found in place names from other dialectical areas. {{IPA|/ai, au/}} are diphthongs {{IPA|[ai̯, au̯]}} in careful speech, {{IPA|[e, o]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ, ɔ]}} in more casual speech. {{IPA|/ai/}}, whichever way it is pronounced, affects following {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}} as {{IPA|/i/}} does.

The alveolars {{IPA|/s ts z dz l/}} are slightly [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. {{IPA|/ts, dz, s, z/}} vary between {{IPA|[ts, dz, s, z]}} and {{IPA|[tʃ, dʒ, ʃ, ʒ]}}, and are especially likely to be the latter when followed by unstressed {{IPA|/i/}}: Thus French ''malgache'' {{IPA-fr|malɡaʃ|}} 'Malagasy'. The velars {{IPA|/k ɡ ᵑk ᵑɡ h/}} are palatalized after {{IPA|/i/}} (e.g. ''alika'' {{IPA|/alikʲa/}} 'dog'). {{IPA|/h/}} is frequently elided in casual speech.

The reported postalveolar [[trilled affricate]]s {{IPA|/ʈʳ ᶯʈʳ ɖʳ ᶯɖʳ/}} are sometimes simple stops,  {{IPA|[ʈ ᶯʈ ɖ ᶯɖ]}}, but they often have a [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] release, {{IPA|[ʈɽ̊˔ ᶯʈɽ̊˔ ɖɽ˔ ᶯɖɽ˔]}}. It is not clear if they are actually trilled, or are simply non-[[sibilant]] affricates {{IPA|[ʈɻ̊˔ ᶯʈɻ̊˔ ɖɻ˔ ᶯɖɻ˔]}}. However, in another Austronesian language with a claimed trilled affricate, [[Fijian language|Fijian]], trilling occurs but is rare, and the primary distinguishing feature is that it is postalveolar.<ref>{{SOWL|131}}</ref> The Malagasy sounds are frequently transcribed {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʈʂ}} ᶯʈʂ {{IPA link|ɖʐ}} ᶯɖʐ]}}, and that is the convention used in this article.<!--we can, of course, change this convention, but would need to follow up with transclusions of {{tl|IPA-mg}} as well.-->

In reduplication, compounding, possessive and verbal constructions, as well as after nasals, fricatives and liquids, 'spirants' become stops, as follows:

===Stress===
Here, stressed syllables are indicated by grave diacritics (''à''), although these diacritics are normally not used.

Words are generally accented on the penultimate syllable, unless the word ends in ''ka'', ''tra'' and often ''na'', in which case they are stressed on the antepenultimate syllable. [[Secondary stress]]es exist in even-numbered syllables from the last stressed syllable, when the word has more than four syllables (''fàmantàranàndro'' {{IPA|[ˌfamˌtarˈnandʐʷ]}} "watch, clock"). Both affixation and prefixation do not affect stress placement.

In many dialects, unstressed vowels (except {{IPA|/e/}}) are devoiced, and in some cases almost completely [[elision|elided]]; thus ''[[fanorona|fanòrona]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[fə̥ˈnurnə̥]}}.

== Grammar == <!--morphology and syntax?-->

=== Word order ===
Malagasy has a [[verb–object–subject]] (VOS) [[word order]]:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Mamaky boky ny mpianatra
|reads book the student
|"The student reads the book"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Nividy ronono ho an'ny zaza ny vehivavy
|bought milk for the child the woman
|"The woman bought milk for the child"}}

Within phrases, Malagasy order is typical of [[Head-directionality parameter|head-initial languages]]: Malagasy has prepositions rather than postpositions (''ho an'ny zaza'' "for the child"). Determiners precede the noun, while quantifiers, modifying adjective phrases, and relative clauses follow the noun (''ny boky'' "the book(s)", ''ny boky mena'' "the red book(s)", ''ny boky rehetra'' "all the books", ''ny boky novakin'ny mpianatra'' "the book(s) read by the student(s)").

Somewhat unusually, demonstrative determiners are repeated both before and after the noun ''ity boky ity'' "this book" (lit. "this book this").

=== Verbs ===
Verbs have syntactically three productive "voice" forms according to the thematic role they play in the sentence: the basic "agent focus" forms of the majority of Malagasy verbs, the derived "patient focus" forms used in "passive" constructions, and the derived "goal focus" forms used in constructions with focus on instrumentality. Thus

*(1) ''Manasa ny tanako amin'ny savony aho''. ("I am washing my hands with soap.")
*(2) ''Sasako amin'ny savony ny tanako''. ("My hands are washed with soap by me.")
*(3) ''Anasako ny tanako ny savony''. ("It is with soap that my hands are washed by me.")

all mean "I wash my hands with soap" though focus is determined in each case by the sentence initial verb form and the sentence final (noun) argument: ''manasa'' "wash" and ''aho'' "I" in (1), ''sasako'' "wash" and ''ny tanako'' "my hands" in (2), ''anasako'' "wash" and ''ny savony'' "soap" in (3). There is no equivalent to the English preposition ''with'' in (3).

Verbs inflect for past, present, and future tense, where tense is marked by prefixes (e.g. ''mividy'' "buy", ''nividy'' "bought", ''hividy'' "will buy").

=== Nouns and pronouns ===
Malagasy has no grammatical gender, and nouns do not inflect for number. However, pronouns and demonstratives have distinct singular and plural forms (cf. ''io boky io'' "that book", ''ireto boky ireto'' "these books").

There is a complex series of demonstrative pronouns, depending on the speaker's familiarity and closeness to the referent.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The following set of pronouns are the pronouns found in Standard Malagasy. Note: the nominative first person singular pronoun is divided between a long and short form; the long form occurs before a verb (focalized or topicalized subjects) and the short form after a verb. The genitive first and second person pronouns are also divided between long and short forms; the long form occurs if the root ends with anything but [na], [ka*] or [tra]; if the stem ends with [na], the long form also occurs but [na] is deleted; and if the stem ends with [ka*] or [tra], the final vowel of the root is deleted and the short form occurs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zribi-Hertz |first1=Anne |last2=Mbolatianavalona |first2=Liliane |title=Towards a Modular Theory of Linguistic Deficiency: Evidence from Malagasy Personal Pronouns |date=1999 |pages=171–172 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225863051 |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref>

===Deixis===
Malagasy has a complex system of [[deixis]] (these, those, here, there, etc.), with seven degrees of distance as well as [[evidentiality]] across all seven. The evidential dimension is prototypically visible vs. non-visible referents; however, the non-visible forms may be used for visible referents which are only vaguely identified or have unclear boundaries, whereas the visible forms are used for non-visible referents when these are topical to the conversation.<ref>Janie Rasoloson and Carl Rubino, 2005, "Malagasy", in Adelaar & Himmelmann, eds, ''The Austronesian languages of Asia and Madagascar''</ref>

Notes:

* Deixis marked by a * are rarely used.

==Vocabulary==
Malagasy shares much of its basic vocabulary with the [[Ma'anyan language]], a language from the region of the [[Barito River]] in southern [[Borneo]]. The Malagasy language also includes some borrowings from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Bantu languages]] (especially the [[Sabaki languages|Sabaki]] branch, from which most notably [[Swahili language|Swahili]] derives), and more recently from French and English.

The following samples are of the Merina dialect or Standard Malagasy, which is spoken in the capital of Madagascar and in the central highlands or "plateau", home of the [[Merina people]].<ref name="Malagasy-English Winterton"/><ref>{{Cite book |title=Malagasy–English / English–Malagasy: Dictionary and Phrasebook |last=Rasoloson |first=Janie |publisher=Hippocrene Books |year=2001}}</ref> It is generally understood throughout the island.

== Lexicography ==
[[File:VocabulaireMalgache1773BULAC.JPG|thumb|Malagasy lexicon (1773) (Collection BULAC Paris)]]
The first dictionary of the language is [[Étienne de Flacourt]]'s ''Dictionnaire de la langue de Madagascar'' published in 1658 though earlier glossaries written in Arabico-Malagasy script exist. A later ''Vocabulaire Anglais-Malagasy'' was published in 1729. An 892-page Malagasy–English dictionary was published by James Richardson of the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1885, available as a reprint; however, this dictionary includes archaic terminology and definitions. Whereas later works have been of lesser size, several have been updated to reflect the evolution and progress of the language, including a more modern, bilingual frequency dictionary based on a corpus of over 5 million Malagasy words.<ref name="Malagasy-English Winterton">[https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&id=-H5Yj7Eki3YC#v=onepage&q&f=false] Winterton, Matthew et al.
