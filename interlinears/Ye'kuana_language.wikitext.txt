'''Ye'kuana''' ({{IPA-all|jeʔkwana|Ye'kuana:}}), also known as '''Maquiritari''', '''Dekwana''', '''Ye'kwana''', '''Ye'cuana''', '''Yekuana''', '''Cunuana''', '''Kunuhana''', '''De'cuana''', '''De’kwana Carib''', '''Pawana''', '''Maquiritai''', '''Maquiritare''', '''Maiongong''', or '''Soto''' is the language of the [[Ye'kuana]] people of Venezuela and Brazil. It is a [[Cariban language]]. It is spoken by approximately 5,900 people (c. 2001) around the border of northwestern Brazilian state of [[Roraima]] and Venezuela – the majority (about 5,500) in Venezuela. At the time of the 2001 Venezuelan census, there were at 6,523 Ye’kuana living in Venezuela.<ref name="Cáceres">{{cite thesis |type=PhD dissertation |last=Cáceres |first=Natalia |date=2011 |title=Grammaire fonctionelle-typologique du Ye'kwana |publisher=Lumière University Lyon 2|language=fr |trans-title=Functional-Typological Grammar of Ye'kwana |url=http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/tese%3Acaceres-2011/caceres_2011_yekwana.pdf}}</ref> Given the unequal distribution of the Ye’kuana across two South American countries, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists two different [[Endangered language|vitality]] ratings for Ye’kuana: in Venezuela it is listed as Vigorous (6a), while in Brazil it is classified Moribund (8a) on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition|last=Lewis|first=Paul|last2=Simons|first2=Gary F.|last3=Fennig|first3=Charles D.|date=2016|publisher=SIL International}}</ref>

==History==
In Brazil, the Ye’kuana are believed to have settled on the lands they now occupy more than a century ago, coming from the larger population centres in Venezuela. [[Brazilian mythology|Traditional mythology]] and oral history, however, tells that the lands around the [[Auari River|Auari]] and [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]] rivers have long been travelled by the Ye’kuana.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/yekwana |title=Ye'kwana |last=Moreira-Lauriola |first=Elaine |date=September 2003 |website=Povos Indígenas no Brasil |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>

During the 18th century, there was a lot of [[missionary]] activity in Ye'kuana territory, during which they were forced into constructing forts for the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]], and coerced into converting to [[Catholicism]].<ref name="pibhoc">{{cite web |url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/yekwana/743 |title=History of Contact |last=Moreira-Lauriola |first=Elaine |date=September 2003 |website=Povos Indígenas no Brasil |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> A rebellion was organised against the Spanish in 1776. The 20th century brought a new wave of exploitation in the form of the colonists looking to capitalise on the discovery of rubber. Whole villages were forced into labour, driven in [[chain gangs]] to the [[Natural rubber|rubber]] camps. Later, another wave of missionaries arrived around the early 1960s. The Brazilian Ye'kuana decided not to live in the missions established on that side of the border, because the missionaries’ attention in Brazil was focused on the [[Sanumá]] and not on them. They were also more reluctant to convert, having seen their Venezuelan cousins convert and become (from the Brazilian Ye'kuana perspective) culturally weaker as a result, giving up key elements of their traditional ways of life. On the Venezuelan side of the border, this wave of missionaries brought the establishment of health services, [[Education|schools]], and access to local markets, also creating several relatively large communities centred around the missions.<ref name="pibhoc"/>

In 1980, a married Canadian missionary couple came to live among the Ye’kuana for a while, but they did not like their way of life, and there were disagreements between them and the Ye’kuana, and they left. After this, the Brazilian Ye’kuana decided that they did not want religion, but they did want a school, seeing the benefits that that infrastructure had provided [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] communities in Venezuela. They got one, after negotiating with the leader of the [[Evangelical Mission of Amazônas]]. So began a process of becoming [[sedentary]], wherein the Ye’kuana all moved closer together, and established semi-regular schedules (including that certain times of day for children were set aside for school). This establishment of solid permanent contact also led to more far-reaching mobilisation and contact with other indigenous communities and the state of Roraima. The Ye’kuana became known as skilled [[canoe]] makers and [[manioc]] scrapers, all while remaining fairly removed from the intense river traffic and influx of outsiders that had harmed many other indigenous communities.<ref name="pibhoc"/>

==Typology==
The Ye’kuana language is situated typologically in the [[Cariban languages|Cariban]] family, which is subdivided into seven subfamilies and one uncategorised language. Ye’kuana is a member of the Guianan Carib subfamily, along with ten other languages. The Guianan languages are located, for the most part, around the [[Guiana Shield]]. Ye’kuana and Wayumara form a smaller category within the Guianan subfamily, the Maquiritari-Wayumara subfamily.

==Literature==
The first [[Language documentation|documentations]] of Ye’kuana in the nineteenth century consist of several wordlists by Schomburgk,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Schomburgk |first=Robert H. |date=1848 |title=Remarks to accompany a comparative vocabulary of eighteen languages and dialects of Indian Tribes inhabiting Guiana |magazine=Simmond's Colonial Magazine |issue=15 |pages=46–64}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Schomburgk |first=Robert H. |date=June 1849 |title=Remarks to accompany a comparative vocabulary of eighteen languages and dialects of Indian Tribes inhabiting Guiana |magazine=Notices and Abstracts of Communications to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at the Oxford Meeting |issue=18 |pages=96–99}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Schomburgk |first=Robert H. |date=1850 |title=A vocabulary of the Maiongkong language |magazine=Proceedings of the Philological Society |issue=IV |pages=217–223}}</ref> followed by several comparative<ref>{{cite book|last=Latham|first=Robert Gordon|title=Elements of comparative philology|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.44766|date=1862|publisher=Walton and Maberly|location=London}}</ref> and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaffanjon|first1=Jean|title=L'Orénoque et le Caura: Relation des voyages exécutés en 1886 et 1887|date=1889|publisher=Librairie Hachette|location=Paris|language=fr|trans-title=The Orinoco and the Caura: Account of Voyages Undertaken in 1886 and 1887}}</ref> works.

==Morphology==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
Ye’kuana's morphology is comparable to that of other Cariban languages.<ref name="Cáceres"/>{{rp|107}} Ye'kuana makes use of the following major grammatical [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Grammatical tense|past]] and non-past. The 'past' aspect is subdivided into recent and distant (the much more used of the two) as well as [[perfective]] and [[imperfective]].<ref name="Cáceres"/>{{rp|213–221}} The 'non-past' is used for present, near future, and general truths.<ref name="Cáceres"/>{{rp|222–225}} As well, probable and definite future aspects are [[Linguistic morphology|morphologically]] distinct, there is a distinct imperfective suffix, and the [[iterative aspect|iterative]], [[durative]] (past), [[inchoative]], [[terminative aspect|terminative]] aspects are all marked, the latter three being marked periphrastically, rather than with a [[suffix]] like the others.<ref name="Cáceres"/>{{rp|226–253}}

The first person plural is represented by three forms in Ye'kuana: a dual inclusive form küwü, a dual exclusive form nña, and a plural inclusive form künwanno. There is no plural exclusive form.

===Derivational morphology===
There is an extensive and productive [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] system, including [[Nominalization|nominalising]], verbalising, and adverbialising suffixes.<ref>All forms are given in forms so as to make morphology obvious, occasionally the forms given are not the surface forms</ref> The system of nominalisation allows for [[adverb]]s to be converted, for instance ''judume'' ‘black’ becomes ''judum-ato'' ‘that which is black’, ''eetö'' ‘here’ becomes ''eeto-no'' ‘that which is here’, etc.; it also has many varieties of verbal nominalisation: intransitivisation, participlisation, agentivisation (''önöö'' ‘eat (meat)’ becomes ''t-önöö-nei'' ‘eater of meat’), deverbal nominalisation of action, instrumental (''a’deuwü'' ‘talk’ gives ''w-a’deuwü-tojo'' ‘telephone’), and nominalisation of a participle. In terms of verbalisation, there is the benefactive ‘give N to someone, bring N to something’, such as ''a’deu'' ‘language, word’ becoming ''a’deu-tö'' ‘read, repeat’; its reverse, the privative (''womü'' ‘clothes’ -> ''i-womü-ka'' ‘undress someone); a general verbalisation suffix ''-ma''; ''-nö'' which can be used to make transitive verbs; -ta which can be used to make intransitive verbs such as vomit and speak; and the occasional suffixes ''-dö'', ''-wü'', and ''-’ñö''. Finally, the adverbialising suffixes include: nominal possessive, participial, abilitive, a form that indicates the destination of a movement, one indicating aptitude, indicating newness of action, potential, and deverbal negative.

===Aspects===
====Future====
The probable future aspect is indicated with the suffix ''-tai'', composed of the future marker ''-ta'' and the irrealis marker ''-i''. It does not occur frequently in the elicited data in Cáceres (2011),<ref name="Cáceres"/> and it indicates an event for which a probability of its taking place exists, without certainty.  The certain future is likewise rarely marked in spontaneous speech.<ref name="Cáceres"/> Examples of the probable future given in the grammar include phrases that translate to “you will learn the Ye'kuana language” and “tomorrow it will become red”, contrasted with the certain future examples: “another day I will come and I will see you” (where the second verb is the one marked).

===Valency marking===
The language presents several strategies for changing the [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] of a verb, primarily a detransitiviser prefix and several causativiser suffixes.

==== Detransitive ====
The base form detransitiviser is postulated to have the form ''öt-'', and has eight allomorphs: ''öt-, ö-, ö’-, ot-, o’-, o-, at-'', and ''a''-.

Transitive verb roots beginning (at the surface level) with ''e'' take the detransitive prefix ''öt-'':

{{interlinear|indent=2
|eeka        öt-ööka
|{'to bite'} {'to bite oneself'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|eicha        öt-öicha
|{'to paint'} {'to paint oneself'}
|}}

Transitive roots beginning with ''o'', or with ''e'' where the second vowel is [+round] take ''ot-'':

{{interlinear|indent=2
|ooneja         ot-ooneja
|{'to measure'} {'to fight'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|enku'to    ot-onku'to
|{'to lie'} {'to be mistaken'}
|}}

Transitive roots beginning with ''a'' take ''at-'':

{{interlinear|indent=2
|a'dojo      at-a'dojo
|{'to drop'} {'to fall'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|aiyo         at-aiyo
|{'to break'} {'to break oneself (fracture)'}
|}}

For the most part, the patterning of the allomorphs is phonologically-based, however, some roots have slight differences in meaning depending on the allomorph they receive:

{{interlinear|indent=2
|adö          a-adö             at-adö
|{'to carry'} {'to be carried'} {'to follow'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|ajöi        a-ajöi                at-ajöi
|{'to take'} {'to attach oneself'} ???
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|ene        ö-öne                     öt-öne
|{'to see'} {'to be seen, look like'} {'to see oneself'}
|}}

==== Causative ====

All classes of verb in Ye’kuana can receive a causative suffix, but each of the two types of [[intransitive]] verbs (termed U<sub>P</sub> and U<sub>A</sub>) has their own suffix that they take. Intransitive verbs of type U<sub>P</sub> can take the suffixes ''-nüjü'' (with allomorphs ''-mjü'' and ''-nü’'') and ''-nöjü'' (with allomorphs ''-mjü'' and ''-nö’''), and the result is a [[transitive verb|transitive]] verb:
:{| class="wikitable"
!Intransitive
!English
!Transitive
!English
|- align="left"
|ünükü
|'sleep'

|seedeta
|'dry'
|sedena-mjü
|'make dry'
|- align="left"
|edenna
|'stop'
|edenna-mjü
|'finalise something'
|}

Transitive verbs and intransitive verbs of type U<sub>A</sub> can take the causative suffix ''-jo''. In the case of transitive verbs, another argument is added to the valency of the verb, while intransitives maintain their initial valency. This suffix is used relatively rarely with intransitive verbs, and of all the examples given below begin with /e/, so it is theorised that these verbs take this suffix because they are derived from transitives, however this theory has not been proven.<ref name="Cáceres"/>

|}

===Plurality===
All unmarked nouns in Ye’kuana can be understood [[Semantics|semantically]] as singular or "general" in number, while some nouns can receive explicit plural marking that distinguishes them from the singular/general-numbered nouns.<ref name="Coutinho"/> Ye’kuana generally uses the suffix ''=komo'' to mark the nominal plural. Cáceres (2011) treats this suffix as a generic plural, while other authors such as Coutinho (2013) subscribe to the analysis given to other Cariban languages that they distinguish in number between the ‘all’ (i.e. collective) and ‘less-than-the-total’ (i.e. non-collective), and therefore treats this morpheme as a collective morpheme. After high-front vowel [i] and approximant [j], the palatalised variant ''=chomo'' is also seen. This suffix is used likewise for [[Animacy|animate]] nouns and inanimate nouns:

{{interlinear|indent=2
|ye'kwana ye'kwana{{=}}komo
|{'ye'kuana'} {'several ye'kuanas'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|yanwaa yanwaa{{=}}komo
|{'man'} {'several men'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|öji öji{{=}}chomo
|{'medicine'} {'several medicines'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|nma nma{{=}}komo
|{'house'} {'several houses'}
|}}

However, there are some restrictions on the distribution of this morpheme, for instance that names of animals cannot take it:

In the Caura dialect studied by Cáceres (2011), a few other nouns exist that some speakers consider ungrammatical with the plural suffix, but others do not:

{{interlinear|indent=2
|uu (*)uu{{=}}komo
|'manioc' {}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|kankudu (*)kankudu{{=}}komo
|'[[calabash]]' {}
|}}

However, in the Auaris dialect, as examined by Coutinho (2013), the plural forms of these nouns and others were all accepted:

{{interlinear|indent=2
|uu uu{{=}}komo
|'manioc' {'several maniocs'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|kankudu kankudu{{=}}komo
|'calabash' {'several calabashes'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|natö natö{{=}}komo
|'[[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]' {'several yams'}
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|tukuudi tukuudi{{=}}chomo
|'jug' {'several jugs'}
|}}

Even in the Auaris dialect, certain nouns denoting fruit do not accept the plural marker:

:{|
|*faduudu=komo
|'several bananas'
|-
|*sokwa=komo
|'several sokwas'
|-
|*ashiichadu
|'several canes'
|}
