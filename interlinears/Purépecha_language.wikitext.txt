'''Purépecha''' (also '''''P'urhépecha''''' {{IPA-xx|pʰuˈɽepet͡ʃa|}}, {{lang-tsz|Phorhé}} or ''Phorhépecha''), often called '''Tarascan''' ({{lang-es|Tarasco}}),<ref>[http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/michoacan.html MICHOACÁN: A STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY]</ref> is a [[language isolate]] or small [[language family]] that is spoken by some 140,000 [[Purépecha]] in the highlands of [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]].

Purépecha was the main language of the pre-Columbian [[Tarascan State]] and became widespread in northwestern Mexico during its heyday in the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic_Period|late post-Classic period]]. The small town of Purepero got its name from the indigenous people who lived there. Other groups that existed{{where|date=September 2021}} then were the Aztec and the Maya
(ca. 1400&ndash;1521).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mexicoguru.com/articles/purepecha.php|title=The Purepecha of Michoacan - Purepecha - Mexico Guru|website=www.mexicoguru.com|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|reason=The Mexico Guru webpage gives no explicit discussion of what groups existed and within what geographical region.|date=September 2021}}

Even though it is spoken within the boundaries of [[Mesoamerica]], Purépecha does not share many of the traits defining the [[Mesoamerican language area]], suggesting that the language is a remnant of an indigenous pre-Aztec substrate that existed several thousands of years ago before the migration of speakers that contributed to the formation of the [[sprachbund]], or alternatively is a relatively new arrival to the area.

==Classification==
Purépecha has long been classified as a language isolate unrelated to any other known language. That judgement is repeated in [[Lyle Campbell|Lyle Campbell's]] authoritative classification.{{sfn|Campbell|1997}} [[Joseph Greenberg]] assigned it to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]],{{sfn|Greenberg|1987}} but like the rest of his American classification, that proposal is rejected by specialists.{{sfn|Campbell|1997}}

There are a number of dialects,{{sfn|Friedrich|1971a}} which [[SIL International]] divides into two languages, but Campbell (1997) considers Purépecha to be a single language.

==Demography==
The language is spoken mostly in rural communities in the highlands of Michoacán. The former center of the Tarascan State was around [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] and remains an important center of the Purépecha community.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' counts Purépecha as two languages: a central language, spoken by approximately 40,000 people (2005) around Pátzcuaro, and a western highland language, spoken by 135,000 speakers (2005) around [[Zamora, Michoacán|Zamora]], [[Los Reyes, Michoacán|Los Reyes de Salgado]], [[Paracho de Verduzco]], and [[Pamatácuaro]], all of which are in the vicinity of the volcano [[Parícutin]]. Recent migration has formed communities of speakers in the cities of [[Guadalajara]], [[Tijuana]] and [[Mexico City]] and in the [[United States]]. The total population of speakers is rising (from 58,000 in 1960 to 96,000 in 1990 and 120,000 in 2000{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza |2006|p=53}}), but the percentage of speakers relative to non-speakers is falling, and the degree of [[multilingualism|bilingualism]] is rising, which makes it an [[endangered language]]. Fewer than 10% of speakers are now monolingual.{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|p=53}}

==History==
[[File:Diccionario en lengua tarasca en lengua de Mechuacan (1559).tif|thumbnail|left|Dictionary of the ''Mechuacan'' (Michoacán, Tarascan) language, Fray [[Maturino Gilberti]], 1559]]

The Purépecha are known to have migrated from elsewhere to their current location, as their tradition includes stories of having traveled from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to their current locations. [[Ethnohistory|Ethnohistorical]] accounts mention them as a people dwelling in the same region of Michoacán they live in now as early as the 13th century. According to the [[:es:Relación de Michoacán|''Relación de Michoacán'']], the communities around Lake Pátzcuaro were gathered into the strong Purépecha State by the leader of the Uacúsecha group of Purépecha speakers, [[Tariácuri]]. Around 1300, he undertook the first conquests of other and installed his sons [[Hiripan]] and [[Tangáxoan]] as lords of [[Ihuatzio]] and [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] respectively while he himself ruled from [[Pátzcuaro City]]. By the time of the death of [[Taríacuri]], in around 1350, his lineage was in control of all the major centers around Lake Pátzcuaro.

His son Hiripan continued the expansion into the area surrounding [[Lake Cuitzeo]]. In 1460 the Purépecha State reached the Pacific Coast at [[Zacatula]], advanced into the [[Toluca Valley]], and also, on the northern rim, reached into the present-day state of [[Guanajuato]]. In the 15th century, the Purépecha state was at war with the Aztecs. Many [[Nahua peoples]] who had lived side by side with Purépecha-speakers were relocated outside of the Tarascan frontiers, and [[Otomi language|Otomi]]-speakers fleeing the Aztec expansion resettled on the border between the two polities. That created a fairly homogeneous area of Purépecha speakers, with no other languages spoken in the core area around Lake Pátzcuaro.{{sfn|Pollard|1993}}
[[File:Oraciones en tarasco.pdf|thumb|page=7|Prayer book in the language by J. J. Apolonio Maya dated 1849 (click to browse).]]
During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Purépecha State was at first peacefully incorporated into the realm of [[New Spain]], but with the killing of Cazonci [[Tangaxuán II]] by [[Nuño de Guzmán]], the relation became one of Spanish dominance by force. Exceptions were the hospital communities of [[Vasco de Quiroga]], such as [[Santa Fé de la Laguna]], where Purépecha could live with a degree of protection from Spanish domination. Through Spanish friars, the Purépecha learned to write in the [[Latin script]], and Purépecha became a literary language in the early colonial period. There is a body of written sources in Purépecha from the period, including several dictionaries, confessionaries, and land titles. Among the most important colonial works are the grammar (1558)<ref>Gilberti, Fray Maturino. 1987. ''Arte de la lengua de Michuacan'' [facsimile 1558] Benedict Warren (ed.) Morelia, Michoacán: Fimax.</ref> and dictionary (1559)<ref>Gilberti, Fray Maturino. 1991. ''Vocabulario en lengua de Mechuacan'' [Facsimile 1559] Benedict Warren (ed.) Morelia, Michoacán: Fimax.</ref> of Fray [[:es:Maturino Gilberti|Maturino Gilberti]], and the grammar and dictionary (1574) by Juan Baptista de Lagunas <ref>Lagunas, Juan Baptista de. 1984. ''Arte y Dictionario Con Otras Obras en Lengua Michuacana''. Benedict Warren (ed.) Morelia, Michoacán: Fimax.</ref>

From ca. 1700, the status of Purépecha changed, and throughout the 20th century, the Mexican government pursued a policy of [[Hispanicization]]. Speakers of indigenous languages were actively encouraged to abandon their languages in favor of Spanish. However, in accord with international changes in favor of recognizing the [[linguistic rights]] of [[indigenous peoples]] and promoting [[multiculturalism]] in colonial states, the [[Congress of the Union]] of Mexico approved the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] in 2003, giving Purépecha and Mexico's other indigenous languages official status as "national languages."

== Orthography ==
[[File:Purépecha tospråklig skole.jpg|thumb|A bilingual Purépecha/Spanish school in the Purépecha community of [[Janitzio]], Michoacán. Since Mexico's 2000 indigenous language law, indigenous languages like Purépecha share the same status as Spanish in the areas in which they are spoken, and many schools offer the curriculum in indigenous languages.]]
The official alphabet is the P{{hamza}}URHEPECHA JIMBO KARARAKUECHA (Purépecha Alphabet):
*'''''a  b  ch  ch{{hamza}} d  e  g  i  ï  j  k  k{{hamza}} m  n  nh  o  p  p{{hamza}} r  rh  s  t  t{{hamza}} ts  ts{{hamza}} u  x'''''.{{sfn|Pahuamba et al|1997}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purhepecha.com.mx/takukata.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120024250/http://www.purhepecha.com.mx/takukata.php |archive-date=2010-11-20 }}</ref>

The letters ''b, d, g'' occur in spelling only after ''m, n'': ''mb, nd, ng'', which reflects the pronunciation of ''p, t, k'' after nasal consonants.

== Phonology ==
In all dialects of Purépecha, the [[stress accent]] is phonemic. As in [[Spanish orthography]], a stressed syllable is indicated by the [[acute accent]]. Minimal pairs are formed: 
*''karáni'' 'write' — ''kárani'' 'fly'
*''p'amáni'' 'wrap it' — ''p'ámani'' 'touch a liquid'
Usually, the second syllable of the word is stressed, but occasionally, it is the first.

The phonemic inventory of the Tarécuato dialect is presented below.{{sfn|De Wolf|1989}} It differs from other dialects in having a velar nasal phoneme. The table of phonemes uses the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and also gives the alphabet equivalents, enclosed in angle brackets, if it is not obvious.

===Vowels===
{| class="wikitable"
|- align=center
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-

| align="center"|{{IPA|i}}

| align="center"|{{IPA|e}}
|
| align="center"|{{IPA|o}}
|- align=center
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| align="center"|{{IPA|ɑ}}
|
|}

The two mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o/}} are uncommon, especially the latter.

The high central vowel is almost always after {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} and is then almost an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/i/}}.

The final vowel of a word is usually whispered or deleted except before a pause.

Vowel clusters are very rare except for sequences that are generated by adding grammatical suffixes like the plural -''echa'' or -''icha'', the copula -''i'', or the genitive -''iri''. Vowel clusters are usually not the first two sounds of a word.

===Consonants===
Purépecha is one of the few languages in the Mesoamerica without a [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[glottal stop]] (a distinction shared by the [[Huave language]] and by some [[Nahuan languages]]). It lacks any [[lateral consonant|laterals]] ('l'-sounds). However, in the speech of many young speakers, the retroflex rhotic has been replaced by {{IPA|[l]}} under the influence of Spanish.{{sfn|Chamoreau|2003b|p=25}}

There are distinct series of nonaspirated and [[aspirated consonant]]s and [[affricate consonant]]s; aspiration is noted by an apostrophe. There are two [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]] ('r'-sounds, one of them being [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]).

!colspan="2"| [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
| 
| 
| {{IPA|j}} {{angbr|i}}
|
| {{IPA|w}} {{angbr|u}}
|}

The official orthography does not have distinct representations for the four phonemes {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, {{IPA|/kʷʰ/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}. It uses the letter {{angbr|i}} for both {{IPA|/i, j/}} and the letter {{angbr|u}} for both {{IPA|/u, w/}}, but both semivowels are fairly rare. When {{angbr|k}} or {{angbr|k'}} is followed by {{angbr|u}} and another vowel letter, the sequence virtually always represents the labio-velar phonemes.

Intervocally, aspirated consonants become [[preaspiration|pre-aspirated]]. After nasals, they lose their aspiration entirely. Unaspirated consonants become voiced after nasals.

==Grammar==
===Typology===
Purépecha is an [[agglutinative language]], but [[sound change]] has led to a certain degree of fusion. It is sometimes considered a [[polysynthetic language]] because of its complex morphology and frequent long words.{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|p=61}} Unlike most other languages that are considered polysynthetic, it has no [[compound (linguistics)|noun compound]]ing or [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]. The language is exclusively suffixing and has a large number of suffixes (as many as 160{{sfn|Pollard|1993}}) and [[clitic]]s. The verb distinguishes 13 aspects and 6 modes. The language is [[double-marking language|double-marking]] in the typology of [[Johanna Nichols]], as it marks grammatical relations on both the dependent phrases and phrasal heads.

The language has both [[grammatical case]] and [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]]. The case system distinguishes [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[comitative case|comitative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], and [[locative case|locative]] cases, but there are also many nominal derivational affixes. [[Word order]] is flexible, and the basic word order has been described as either [[subject–verb–object|SVO]]{{sfn|Capistrán|2002}} or [[subject–object–verb|SOV]].{{sfn|Friedrich|1984}} However, most authors note that other word orders are frequently used for [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] purposes such as [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] or [[topic and comment|topic tracking]].{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|p=71}}

===Nouns===
Nouns are inflected by the basic formula Noun + Number + Case.

The language distinguishes between plural and unspecified numbers, with no dedicated singular form.{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|pp=74-75}}

Plurals formed by the suffix ''-echa/-icha'' or ''-cha''.
*''kúmi-wátsï''  'fox' - ''kúmi-wátsïcha''  'foxes'
*''iréta''  'town' - ''irétaacha''  'towns'
*''warhíticha tepharicha maru''  'some fat women' (lit. women-[[plural|PL]] fat-[[plural|PL]] some).

The nominative case is unmarked. The accusative case (also called the [[objective case]]) is used to mark [[object (grammar)|direct and sometimes indirect objects]] and is marked by the suffix ''-ni'':
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|Pedrú pyásti tsúntsuni
|Pedrú pyá-s-ti tsúntsu-ni
|Pedro buy-PFV-3P pot-ACC
|'Pedro bought the pot'}}

The genitive case is marked by ''-ri'' ''-eri'': 
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|imá wárhitiri wíchu
|imá wárhiti-ri wíchu
|that woman-GEN dog
|'that woman's dog'}}

The locative case is marked by ''-rhu'', ''-o''
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|kúntaati Maríao
|ku-nta-a-ti María-o
|meet-ITER-FUT-3IND Maria-LOC
|'He'll meet him at María's place'{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|p=306}}}}

The instrumental case is marked by the particle ''jimpó'' or the suffix ''-mpu''
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|jiríkurhniniksï tsakápu k'éri má jimpó
|jiríkurhi-ni{{=}}ksï tsakápu k'éri má jimpó

The comitative case is marked by the particle ''jinkóni'' or the suffix ''-nkuni''
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|apóntini warhíti má jinkóni
|apónti-ni wárhiti má jinkóni

|'I'll go with him/her'{{sfn|Villavicencio Zarza|2006|p=381}}}}

Discourse-pragmatic focus on a noun or noun phrase is indicated by the clitic ''-sï''.{{sfn|Capistrán|2002}}
{{interlinear|indent=3|glossing3=yes
|Ampé'''sï''' arhá Pedrú?
|ampé-sï arh-∅-∅-á Pedrú
|what-FOC eat-PFV-INTERR Pedro
|'What did Pedro eat?'}}

|kurúcha'''sï''' atí.
|Kurúcha-sï a-∅-tí
|fish-FOC eat-PFV-3P
|'he ate '''fish'''' (i.e., 'fish is what he ate')}}

===Verbs===
Verbs inflect for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]s and [[grammatical mood|mood]]s as well as for [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the subject and the object. There are also a number of suffixes expressing shape, position, or body parts that affect or are affected by the verbal action.{{sfn|Friedrich|1969}}{{sfn|Friedrich|1970}}{{sfn|Friedrich|1971b}}

[[Transitive verb|Transitivity]] is manipulated by suffixes forming transitive verbs with applicative or [[causative]] meaning or [[intransitive verb|intransitives]] with passive or [[inchoative]] meanings.

==Media==
Purépecha-language programming is broadcast by the radio station [[XEPUR-AM]], located in [[Cherán]], Michoacán. It is a project of the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]].
