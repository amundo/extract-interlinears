The '''Kutenai language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|t|ən|eɪ|,_|-|i}}), also '''Kootenai''', '''Kootenay''', '''Ktunaxa''', and '''Ksanka''', is the native language of the [[Kutenai]] people of [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]] in the United States and [[British Columbia]] in Canada.<ref name="aljazeera" /> It is typically considered a [[language isolate]], unrelated to the [[Salishan]] family of languages spoken by neighboring tribes on the coast and in the interior Plateau. The Kutenai also speak ''ʔa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam'', Ktunaxa Sign Language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Auld|first1=Francis|title=ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/19608956304/|website=Facebook|access-date=22 June 2017|language=kut}}</ref>

==Classification==
Kutenai is typically considered a [[language isolate]]. There have been attempts to place Kutenai in either a Macro-[[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] or Macro-[[Salishan languages|Salishan]] language family, most recently with Salish,<ref name=":0" /> but they have not been generally accepted as proven.<ref>Marianne Mithun. ''The Languages of Native North America'' (1999, Cambridge).</ref><ref>Lyle Campbell. ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America'' (1997, Oxford).</ref>

==Typology==
Like other languages in the area, Kutenai has a rich inventory of consonants and a small inventory of vowels, though there are [[allophone]]s of the three basic phonemic vowels. The lack of a phonemic distinction between [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless consonants is much as in other languages of the area.<ref name=":0" /> Because Kutenai is on the periphery of this linguistic area, the loss of a rich lateral inventory is consistent with other nearby languages, which now have only one or two lateral consonants. One such language group contains the [[Sahaptian languages]], which have had a similar loss of laterals. [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] has {{IPA|/ts/}}, believed to be the lateral affricate in the proto-language. Nez Perce, like Kutenai, lies in the eastern periphery of the Northwest Linguistic area.<ref name=":0" />

Another typological analysis investigates the lexical category of [[preverb]]s in Kutenai. This lexical category distinguishes neighboring [[Algonquian languages]], found to the east of the Kootenay Rocky Mountains and near the Kutenai linguistic area.<ref>Dryer, Matthew S. 2002. "A comparison of Preverbs in Kutenai and Algonquian." In D. Pentland (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the Thirtieth Algonquian Conference'' (pp. 63-94). Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.</ref> Another typological relationship Kutenai could have is the presence of its [[obviative|obviation]] system.<ref>Dryer, Matthew S. 2007. "Kutenai, Algonquian, and the Pacific Northwest from an areal perspective." In H. Wolfart (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the Thirty-Eighth Algonquian Conference'' (pp. 155-206). Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.</ref><ref>Dryer, Matthew S. 1992. "A comparison of the obviation systems of Kutenai and Algonquian." ''Papers of the 23rd Algonquian Conference''. Ottawa: Carleton.</ref>

==Current status==

In 1969, the Kutenai language was spoken by 446 [[Indian Register|registered Indians]] in Canada.<ref name="Indian Lands and Languages">{{cite book | title = National Atlas of Canada | edition = 4th | date = 1974 | pages = 119–120 | url = https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ba50b10c-a44b-5cc9-a2b5-1f143d13a483}}</ref>

As of 2012, the Ktunaxa people in Canada are working on a language revitalization effort.<ref name = "aljazeera">{{Cite web

The FirstVoices Tutor provides lessons and practices in the given language. The Ktunaxa Language app, accessible for iOS devices, is a Ktunaxa dictionary which uses the audio recordings of words and phrases, and provides flashcards with audio, of the vocabulary found on the FirstVoices website. The Ktunaxa nation aims to target younger generations with the FirstVoices materials to teach fluency in the Kutenai language.<ref>Pagliaro, J. 2010. "Technology gives dying languages voice." ''Geolinguistics'' 37: 114-116.</ref>

One such example is the ʔAq̓am community of the Ktunaxa Nation, also known as St. Mary's band in Cranbrook B.C, which has a private elementary school called the ʔaq̓amnikSchool. This school, as well as providing standard BC curriculum, teaches the Ktunaxa language and cultural traditions of the people to younger generations. It also has an after school program and a program called Headstart, which helps adults of children up to the age of six learn about teaching the Ktunaxa culture and language to their children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqam.net/services/education-services/%CA%94aq%CC%93amnik%E2%80%99-school|title=ʔaq̓amnik' School {{!}} aq'am|website=www.aqam.net|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation have founded the [[Salish Kootenai College]], a tribal college on the Flathead reservation in Pablo, Montana. The college offers a certificate program in Native American studies, which requires that students have knowledge of the history and culture of the Salish and Ktunaxa people. The curriculum also offers classes in basic Kutenai language pronunciation and grammar.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Salish Kootenai College | access-date = 2016-11-11 | url = https://www.skc.edu/}}</ref> Some sources suggest that the knowledge and preservation of the native communities culture will contribute to the preservation of the communities language, but there is no evidence yet from the Salish Kootenai College to support this claim.<ref>Richardson, Louise B. 1997. "Tribal College Curricula as Evidence for the Contemporary Use of Indigenous Languages in North America." ''Geolinguistics'' 23: 61-77.</ref>

College of the Rockies main campus is in Cranbrook B.C on the territory of the Ktunaxa people. As such, the college has collaborated with the Ktunaxa people for 40 years as of 2015. As well as offering indigenous studies classes, the College of the Rockies offers basic Ktunaxa classes online, KTUN-101 and KTUN-102, using the FirstVoices website as the primary learning resource. They also offer a Ktunaxa Workshop for beginner learners providing basic phrases and pronunciation, and cultural information of the Ktunaxa people.

==History of description==

The first grammar of Kutenai was compiled by [[Roman Catholic]] missionary Philippo Canestrelli, and was published in 1894 in [[Latin language|Latin]].<ref name=canestrelli1894grammar>{{Cite book

In 1918 Franz Boas published The Kutenai Tales, a transcription and translation of multiple Ktunaxa stories. The stories were gathered by Alexander F. Pierce in 1891 and Boas in 1914, and told by members of the Ktunaxa people including Andrew Pierre, Numan Pierre, Joe Mission, Andrew Felix, and the major contributor from the community, a man referred to as Barnaby.

Paul L. Garvin did various descriptive work describing the [[phonemics]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[syllabification]] in Ktunaxa. He also has two sources of transcriptions of speakers talking.<ref>Garvin, Paul L. 1948. "Kutenai III: Morpheme Distributions (Prefix, Theme, Suffix)."</ref><ref>Garvin 1953</ref>

In 1991 Lawrence Richard Morgan wrote a description of the Kutenai Language as his PhD dissertation through the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. This description is focused on how the language works and specifically defining the working parts of the language. Morgan's work is an exhaustive list of each [[grammatical particle]], [[morpheme]], and [[affix]], with their respective environments and their varying forms.<ref name=":0" />

==Phonology==

===Consonant phonemes===
Kutenai has no phonemic distinction between [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless consonants.<ref name=":0" />

===Vowel phonemes===
[[Vowel length]] in Ktunaxa is also contrastive, so two words can be differentiated just by lengthening or shortening a vowel. Some such [[minimal pair]]s are the verbal stem 'to dig something up' {{IPA|[ʔakaːkʼuː]}} and the noun '(steel animal) trap' {{IPA|[ʔaːkaːkʼuː]}}<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = A Description of the Kutenai Language|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0f76g7f2|website = eScholarship|access-date = 2015-07-29|date = 1991|last = Morgan|first = Lawrence}}</ref> and the verbal stem for 'to fall out in this direction/to fall out from somewhere' {{IPA|[ʔakmuːxuː]}} and 'the place where (someone is) sitting, one's place at a table' {{IPA|[ʔaːkmuːxuː]}}.<ref name=":0" /> Both pairs differ only in the length of the first vowel, [a] vs [a:].

== Orthography ==
Kutenai is written in the Kutenai alphabet, which is derived from the Latin alphabet.

== Grammar ==
In general terms, Kutenai is an [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] language, with many grammatical functions being served by both [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[suffix]]es, primarily on the verb, though some affixes select nouns as well.<ref name=":1">Mast, Susan J. 1988. "Aspects of Kutenai Morphology." Master's Thesis, University of Pittsburgh.</ref> As mentioned above, a distinctive feature of Kutenai is its use of an [[obviative|obviation]] system as a way to track which entities and concepts are particularly central/salient to a story being told and as a grammatical way of clarifying the roles of each entity in sentences with two third-person arguments: "Pronouns, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all take obviative markers",<ref name=":1" /> making it particularly different from some more well-known obviation systems (like the Algonquian one, which allows for obviation only on third-person animate nouns). Kutenai also makes use of an [[direct–inverse language|inverse]] system."<ref name=":2">Dryer, Matthew S. 1991. "Subject and Inverse in Kutenai." Occasional papers on linguistics No. 16, ''Proceedings from the American Indian Languages Conference'' edited by James E. Redden. (Conference held at the University of California at Santa Cruz.)</ref><ref>Dryer, Matthew S. 1994. "The discourse function of the Kutenai inverse." ''Voice and inversion'' 28 (1994): 65.</ref> The language has an overt [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], ''?in'' `to be'.

=== Syntax ===
==== Word order ====
Word order in Kutenai can be flexible in response to [[discourse analysis|discourse]] and [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.<ref name=":0" /> As is the case with many [[head-marking language]]s, it is rare to have both an overt subject and an overt object in a sentence since the morphology of the verb makes it clear who is acting on whom. Morgan states that if it ''is'' appropriate to express both arguments of a verb in a "neutral" context, [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] word order is preferred; however, it also alternates with [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] order.<ref name=":0" /> The pre-verbal position can be occupied by adverbs, as seen in these three examples:

{{interlinear|number=1)
|qa·kiⱡ hiȼ'kiⱡ -ni huki? -s tiⱡna
|ADV search -IND louse/lice -OBV {old woman}
|The old lady started looking for lice.}}

{{interlinear|number=2)
|pik?ak -s naqa?i -ni titkat' qakⱡik xaxa -s
|{long ag}o OBV exist -IND man called crow -OBV
|Long ago there was a man named `Xaxa' (or Crow).}}

{{interlinear|number=3)
|is -iⱡ ȼⱡakiⱡ -ni xaxa na?uti -s
|very {{gcl|PVB|preverb}} like -IND crow girl -OBV
|Crow loves Na?uti.}}

One aspect of Kutenai that complicates word order somewhat is the fact that the verb is marked for first- or second-person subjects by "affixal or clitic pronouns" that precede the stem, ''hu/hun'' for 'I' and ''hin'' for 'you'.<ref name=":0" /> It is common in the orthography to write the pronouns as separate words, making it seem as if the word order is Subject Pronoun + Verb (+ Object).

==== Inverse ====
In many languages, conditions for inverse include situations in which the first or second person is in the "object" role, and the third person is the "subject" as in 'She saw you/me.' In Kutenai, however, the situations use specific "first-/second-person object" morphology, separate from the inverse.<ref name=":2" /> As a consequence, Kutenai's inverse system is most clearly observable in interactions between third persons. The following two examples (from Dryer 1991) show the direct and inverse, respectively:

{{interlinear|number=4)
|wu·kat -i paⱡkiy -s titqat'
|see -IND woman OBV man
|The man saw the woman.}}

{{interlinear|number=5)
|wu·kat -aps -i titqat' -s paⱡkiy
|see -INV -IND man -OBV woman
|The (obviative) man saw the (proximate) woman.}}

==== Clause typing ====
Kutenai [[Dependent clause|subordinate/dependent clauses]] are marked with a ''k'' and a lack of indicative morphology on the verb, as are questions, nominalizations, and relative clauses.<ref name=":0" /> The ''k'' can cliticize to the material that follows it, as can be seen in this example.

{{interlinear|number=6)
|wu·kat -i titqat' -s k- was- aqna -p -s
|see -IND man OBV SUB- quick do -IN OBV
|He saw a man doing something in a hurry. (He saw him, a man that he does something quickly.)}}
