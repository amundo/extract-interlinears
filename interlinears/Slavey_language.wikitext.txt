'''Slavey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|l|eɪ|v|i}};<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref>  also '''Slave''', '''Slavé''') is a group of [[Athabaskan languages]] and a [[dialect continuum]] spoken amongst the [[Dene]] peoples of [[Canada]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] – or central Denendeh – where it also has official status.<ref name="lang">[http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf Northwest Territories Official Languages Act, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408070402/http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf |date=2005-04-08 }} (as amended 1988, 1991-1992, 2003)</ref> The languages are primarily written using a modified [[Latin script]], with some using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]]. In their own languages, these languages are referred to as: '''Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́''' (spoken by the [[Sahtu|Sahtu Dene]]), '''K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́''' (the Hare Dene dialect) and '''Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́''' (the Mountain dialect) in the North, and '''Dené Dháh''' (primarily by the [[Dene Tha' First Nation|Dene Tha']] in [[Alberta]]), '''Dene Yatıé''' or '''Dene Zhatıé''' in the South.

 }}'''North Slavey''' is spoken by the [[Sahtu|Sahtu (North Slavey)]] people in the [[District of Mackenzie|Mackenzie District]] along the middle [[Mackenzie River]] from [[Tulita]] (Fort Norman) north, around [[Great Bear Lake]], and in the [[Mackenzie Mountains]] of the [[Canadian territory]] of [[Northwest Territories]]. The dialect has around 800 speakers.<ref name="census" />
[[File:Yellowknife_text.jpg|thumb|North Slavey text carved into stone in Yellowknife]]
Northern Slavey is an amalgamation of three separate ''dialects'': 
* K’ashógot’įne (ᑲᑊᗱᑯᑎᑊᓀ) Goxedǝ́: Hare, spoken by the ''Gahwié got’iné'' - "Rabbitskin People" or ''K’áshogot’ıne'' - "Great Hare People", referring to their dependence on the varying hare for food and clothing, also called ''Peaux de Lievre'' or ''Locheaux''
* Sahtúgot’įné (ᓴᑋᕲᒼᑯᑎᑊᓀ) Yatı̨́: Bear Lake, spoken by the ''Sahtu Dene'' or ''Sahtú got’iné'' - "Bear Lake People", also known as ''Gens du Lac d'Ours''
* Shíhgot’įne (ᗰᑋᑯᑎᑊᓀ) Yatı̨́: Mountain, spoken by the ''Shıhgot’ıné'', ''Shuhtaot'iné'' or ''Shotah Dene'' - "Mountain People" or ''Mountain Indians'', also called ''Nahagot’iné'', ''Nahaa'' or ''Nahane Dene'' - "People of the west", so called because they lived in the mountains west of the other Slavey groups, between the Mackenzie Mountains and the Mackenzie River, from the Redstone River to the Mountain River

'''South Slavey''' (ᑌᓀ ᒐ ''[[Dene Tha' First Nation|Dené Dháh]]'', ''Dene Yatıé'' or ''Dene Zhatıé'') is spoken by the [[Slavey]] people, who were also known as ''Dehghaot'ine'', ''Deh Cho'', ''Etchareottine'' - "People Dwelling in the Shelter", in the region of [[Great Slave Lake]], upper [[Mackenzie River]] (''Deh Cho'' - "Big River") and its drainage, in the [[District of Mackenzie]], northeast [[Alberta]], northwest [[British Columbia]].

Some communities are bilingual, with the children learning Slavey at home and English when they enter school. Still other communities are monolingual in Slavey <ref name="Rice" /> The dialect has around 1000 speakers.<ref name="census"/>

''Alternate names:'' Slavi, Slave, Dené, Mackenzian

The division of Slavey dialects is based largely on the way each one pronounces the old Proto-Athapaskan sounds *dz *ts *ts’ *s and *z.

The consonant inventories in the dialects of Slavey differ considerably. The table above lists the 30 consonants common to most or all varieties. Hare lacks aspirated affricates (on red background), which have lenited into fricatives, whereas Mountain lacks {{IPA|/w/}} (on blue). In addition, for some speakers of Hare, an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|/ɾ/}} has developed into a separate phoneme. Prenasalized stops {{IPA|/ᵐb, ⁿd/}} may appear in Slavey proper.

The most pronounced difference is however the realization of a series of consonants that varies greatly in their place of articulation:<ref>Krauss, Michael E. & Golla, Victor K. (1981) Northern Athapaskan Languages. ''Handbook of North American Indians'', p. 79.</ref>
{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
! !! Slavey proper !! Mountain !! Bearlake !! Hare
|- 
! Plain stop/affricate
|  {{IPA|t̪θ}} || {{IPA|p}} || {{IPA|kʷ}} || {{IPA|kʷ}}, {{IPA|p}}
|- 
! Aspirated

|- 
! Voiced fricative / semivowel

|}

In Slavey proper, these are [[Dental consonant|dental]] affricates and fricatives; comparative Athabaskan work reveals this to be the oldest sound value. Mountain has labials, with the voiceless stop coinciding with pre-existing {{IPA|/p/}}. Bearlake has [[labialization|labialized]] velars, but has lenited the voiced fricative to coincide with pre-existing {{IPA|/w/}}. The most complicated situation is found in Hare, where the plain stop is a labialized velar, the ejective member is replaced by a {{IPA|/ʔw/}} sequence, the aspirated affricate has turned into a fricative {{IPA|/f/}}, and both the voiceless and voiced fricatives have been lenited to {{IPA|/w/}}.

====Phonological processes====

The following phonological and phonetic statements apply to all four dialects of Slavey.

* Unaspirated obstruents are either voiceless or weakly voiced, e.g.
** {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|[k]}} or {{IPA|[k̬]}}
* Aspirated obstruents are strongly aspirated.
* Ejectives are strongly ejective.
* When occurring between vowels, ejectives are often voiced, e.g.
** {{IPA|/kʼ/}} → {{IPA|[ɡˀ]}} or {{IPA|[kʼ]}}
* {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}} is usually strongly velarized, i.e. {{IPA|[tˣ]}}.
* Velar obstruents are palatalized before front vowels, e.g.
** {{IPA|/kɛ/}} → {{IPA|[cɛ]}}
** {{IPA|/xɛ/}} → {{IPA|[çɛ]}}
** {{IPA|/ɣɛ/}} → {{IPA|[ʝɛ]}}
* Velar fricatives may be labialized before round vowels.
** The voiceless fricative is usually labialized, e.g.
*** {{IPA|/xo/}} → {{IPA|[xʷo]}}
** The voiced fricative is optionally labialized and may additionally be defricated e.g.
*** {{IPA|/ɣo/}} → {{IPA|[ɣo]}} or {{IPA|[ɣʷo]}} or {{IPA|[wo]}}
* Velar stops are also labialized before round vowels. These labialized velars are not as heavily rounded as labial velars (which occur in Bearlake and Hare), e.g.
** {{IPA|/ko/}} → {{IPA|[kʷo]}}
** {{IPA|/kʷo/}} → {{IPA|[k̹ʷwo]}}
* Lateral affricates are generally alveolar, but sometimes velar, i.e.
** {{IPA|/tɬ/}} → {{IPA|[tɬ]}} or {{IPA|[kɬ]}}
** {{IPA|/tɬʰ/}} → {{IPA|[tɬʰ]}} or {{IPA|[kɬʰ]}}
** {{IPA|/tɬʼ/}} → {{IPA|[tɬʼ]}} or {{IPA|[kɬʼ]}}
* {{IPA|/x/}} may be velar or glottal, i.e.
** {{IPA|/x/}} → {{IPA|[x]}} or {{IPA|[h]}}

===Vowels===

* a {{IPA|[a]}}
* e {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}} when followed by a back vowel
* ə {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ie]}}
* i {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in syllable onset
* o {{IPA|[o]}}
* u {{IPA|[u]}}
* nasal vowels are marked with an ogonek accent, e.g. {{angle bracket|ą}} {{IPA|[ã]}}
*Vowel length is distributed as /VV/ in the dialects of Bearlake, Slavey and Mountain.
* South Slavey does not have the {{angle bracket|ə}} vowel.

=== Tone ===

Slavey has two tones:

* high
* low

In Slavey orthography, high tone is marked with an acute accent, and low tone is unmarked.

Tones are both lexical and grammatical.

Lexical: {{IPA|/ɡáh/}} 'along' vs. {{IPA|/ɡàh/}} 'rabbit'

===Syllable structure===
Slavey morphemes have underlying syllable structures in the stems: CV, CVC, CVnC, V, and VC. The prefixes of the stem occur as Cv, CVC, VC, CV, and C.

==Person, number and gender==

===Gender===
Slavey marks gender by means of prefixation on the verb theme. There are three different genders, one of which is unmarked; the other two are marked by prefixes '''[go-]''' and '''[de-]'''. However, only certain verb themes allow gender prefixes.<ref name=Rice/>

'''[go-]''' is used for nouns which mark location in either time or space. Some examples of these areal nouns are house (ko̜̒e̒), land (de̒h), river (deh), and winder (xay).<ref name="Rice" /> The gender pronoun can be a direct object, an oblique object or a possessor.<ref name="Rice" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|kú̜e̒ '''go'''detl’e̒h
|house 3SG.paints.area
|'S/he is painting the house.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ko̜̒e̒ '''go'''cha
|house area.in shelter
|'in the shelter of the house'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ko̜̒e̒ '''go'''deshi̜te̒ee
|house area.floor
|'floor of the house'}}

'''[de-]''' marks wood, leaves and branches. This gender is optional: some speakers use it and others do not.<ref name=Rice/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|tse '''de̜'''la
|wood
|'wood is located'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ʔo̜̒k’ay t’oge '''de̒'''ʔo̜
|bird nest wooden O is located
|'A bird’s nest is located'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|tse ts’e'''de'''hdla̒
|wood 3SG.split.wood
|'S/he is splitting wood.'}}

===Number===
Slavey marks number in the subject prefixes in position 12. The dual is marked by the prefix łe̒h- (Sl)/łe- (Bl)/le- (Hr).

:''ni̒łe̒gehtthe''
:'They two got stuck in a narrow passage.'


The plural is marked with the prefix '''go-'''.

:''Dah'''go'''gehthe''
:'They dance.'

:''ʔeha̒'''go'''ni̒dhe''
:'We go for meat.'

===Person===
Slavey has first, second, third, and fourth person. When in position 12, acting as a subject, first-person singular is /h-/, second-person singular is /ne-/, first-person dual/plural is /i̒d-/, and second person plural is marked by /ah-/. Third person is not marked in this position. When occurring as a direct or indirect object, the pronoun prefixes change and fourth person becomes relevant.

* First-person singular takes se-.
* Second-person singular takes ne-
* Third person is marked by be-/me-
* Fourth person is marked by ye-<ref name=Rice/>

==Classification==
Like most Athabaskan languages, Slavey has a multitude of classifications. There  are five basic categories that describe the nature of an object. Some of these categories are broken up further.<ref name="Rice"/>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Description !! Locative prefix !! Active Prefix !! Examples
|-
| 1a || One dimensional slender, rigid and elongated objects || Ø-to || ∅-tí͔,-tǫ, -tǫ́ || gun, canoe, pencil
|-
| 1b || One directions flexible objects, ropelike; plurals || ∅-ɫa || ∅-ɫee, -ɫa, -ɫee || thread, snowshoes, rope
|-
| 2a || two dimensional flexible || h-chú || h-chuh, -chú, -chu  || open blanket, open tent, paper
|-

|}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|tewhehchú
|water.CL
|'A clothlike object is in the water'<ref name="Rice"/>}}

==Tense and aspect==

===Tense===

Slavey has only one structural tense: future. Other tenses can be indicated periphrastically.<ref name=Rice/>

An immediate future can be formed by the ''de-'' inceptive (position 9) plus ''y-.''

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|dałe
|{3.FUT.start out}
|'S/he is just ready to go.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|nadedajéh
|{3.FUT.start to heal}
|'It is just starting to heal.'}}

===Aspect===
Slavey has two semantic aspects: perfective and imperfective.

The perfective is represented in position 11:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|déhtla
|{3SG.PFV.start off}
|'S/he started off.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|whá goyįdee
|long 3SG.PFV.talk
|'S/he talked for a long time.'}}

The perfective can also be used with a past tense marker to indicate that at the point of reference, which is sometime in the past, the event was completed <ref name=Rice/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|kǫ́e gohtsį
|house 3SG.PFV.build area PAST
|'He had built a house.'}}

The imperfective indicates that the reference time precedes the end of the event time:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|hejį
|3 IPFV.sing
|'S/he sing, s/he is singing.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|kǫ́e gohtsį begháyeyidá
|house 3 IPFV.build area 1SG.PFV.see 3
|'I saw him building a house.'}}

==Word order==
Slavey is a verb-final language. The basic word order is SOV.<ref name=Rice/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Dene ?elá thehtsi̜̒
|man boat 3SG.made
|'The man made the boat.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|tli̜ ts’ǫ̀dani káyi̜̒ta
|dog child 3SG.bit
|'The dog bit the child.'}}

Oblique objects precede the direct object.<ref name="Rice" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|T’eere denǫ  gha ?erákee?ee wihsi̜
|girl mother for parka made
|'The girl made a parka for her mother.'}}

==Case==
Slavey has no case markings. To differentiate between subject, direct object, and oblique objects, word order is used. The subject will be the first noun phrase, and the direct object will occur right before the verb. The oblique objects are controlled by postpositions.<ref name=Rice/>

==Possessives==
<ref name=Rice/>

Possessive pronoun prefixes are found in Slavey. These pronouns have the same forms as the direct and oblique object pronouns. The prefixes are listed below with examples.

===''se-'' first-person singular===

:''bá'' 'mitts'
:''sebáré'' 'my mitts'

:''mbeh'' 'knife'
:''sembehé'' 'my knife'

===''ne-'' second-person singular===

:''ts'ah'' 'hat'
:''net'saré'' 'your (SG) hat'

:''tl'uh'' 'rope'
:''netl'ulé'' 'your (SG) rope'

===''be-/me-'' third-person singular===
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|melįé nátla
|3.POSS.dog 3SG.is.fast
|'His/her dog is fast.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|bekée whihtsį
|3SG.POSS.slippers 1SG.made
|'I made his/her slippers.'}}

===''ye-'' fourth person===
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|yekée whehtsį
|4.POSS.slippers 3SG.made
|'S/he made his/her slippers.'}}

===''ʔe-'' unspecified possessor===

:''ʔelįé'' 'someone's dog'

===''naxe-/raxe-'' first-person plural, second-person plural.===

:''ts'éré'' 'blanket'
:''naxets'éré'' 'our blanket, your (PL) blanket'

===''ku-/ki-/go-'' third-person plural===
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|kulí̜é rała
|3PL.POSS.dog  3SG.is.fast
|'Their dog is fast.'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|goyúé k'enáʔeniihtse
|3PL.POSS.clothes 1SG.washed
|'I washed their clothes.'}}

==Clauses==

===Conjunctions===

There are both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions in Slavey.

====Coordinating====

==Status==

North and South Slavey are recognized as official languages of the Northwest Territories; they may be used in court and in debates and proceedings of the Northwest Territories legislature. However, unlike English and French, the government only publishes laws and documents in North and South Slavey if the legislature requests it, and these documents are not authoritative.<ref>Nitah, S. (2002). One land - many voices: report of the NWT Special Committee on the Review of the Official Languages Act. ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'' 25(3), 4-8.</ref>

In 2015, a Slavey woman named Andrea Heron challenged the territorial government over its refusal to permit the [[Glottal stop|ʔ]] character, representing the Slavey glottal stop, in her daughter's name, Sakaeʔah, despite Slavey languages being official in the NWT. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the character. Heron had registered the name with a hyphen instead of the ʔ when her daughter was born, but when Sakaeʔah was 6, Ms. Heron joined a challenge by a [[Chipewyan]] woman named Shene Catholique-Valpy regarding the same character in her own daughter's name, Sahaiʔa.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Browne|first1=Rachel|title=What's in a name?

Also in 2015, the [[University of Victoria]] launched a language revitalization program in the NWT, pairing learners of indigenous languages including Slavey with fluent speakers. The program requires 100 hours of conversation with the mentor with no English allowed, as well as sessions with instructors in [[Fort Providence, Northwest Territories|Fort Providence]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Erin Brohman|author2=Garrett Hinchey|title=UVic program aims to revitalize South Slavey language in N.W.T.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/uvic-program-aims-to-revitalize-south-slavey-language-in-n-w-t-1.2996608|access-date=5 April 2015|work=CBC News|date=16 March 2015}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Slavey was the native language spoken by the fictional band in the Canadian television series ''[[North of 60]]''. [[Nick Sibbeston]], a former [[Premier of the Northwest Territories]], was a Slavey language and culture consultant for the show.
