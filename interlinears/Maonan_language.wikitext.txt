The '''Maonan language''' ({{zh|c=毛南语|p=Máonán yǔ}}) is a [[Kam–Sui language]] spoken mainly in [[China]] by the [[Maonan people]], specifically in northern [[Guangxi]] and southern [[Guizhou]].<ref name="Lu" />{{rp|33}}<ref name="gx"/> [[Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County]], [[Hechi]], northern [[Guangxi]], holds a concentrated number of speakers.<ref name="Lu">Lu, Tian Qiao (2008). ''A Grammar of Maonan''. Boca Raton, Florida: Universal Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1-59942-971-7}}.</ref>

==Demographics==
Approximately half of all Maonan people are capable of speaking Maonan. In addition to this, many Maonan also speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or a [[Zhuang language]]. About 1/3 of all people who self-identify as Maonan are concentrated in the southern [[Guizhou]] province. They speak a mutually unintelligible dialect commonly called ''Yanghuang'', which is more common known as the [[Then language]] in Western literature. The Maonan do not have a writing system.

Other than [[Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County]] in [[Guangxi]], Maonan is also spoken in the following locations.<ref name="gx">Guangxi Minority Languages Orthography Committee. 2008.

*[[Yizhou District, Hechi|Yizhou]], [[Guangxi]]
*[[Libo County]], [[Guizhou]]
*[[Pingtang County]], [[Guizhou]]

==Phonology==
Maonan is a tonal language with 8 tones (Lu 2008:90–91),<ref name="Lu" /> featuring an SVO clause construction (Lu 2008:169).<ref name="Lu" /> (See [[Proto-Tai language#Tones]] for an explanation of the tone numbers.) For example:

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|man2 na4 kʰaːu3
|  3SG eat wine
|"S/He drinks wine."}}

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|man2 paːi1 hɯ1
|  3SG go market
|"S/He goes to the market."}}

==Syntax==
Maonan displays a head-first modification structure, i.e. the modifier occurring after the modifier (Lu 2008:170).<ref name="Lu" /> For example:

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|kʰaːu3 ɦu4ljaːŋ4 
|wine broomcorn
|"broomcorn wine"}}

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|mu5 laːu4 
|pig big
|"big pig"}}

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|nok7 vin1
|bird fly
|"flying bird" }}

Occasionally, a head-final modification structure is also possible with the involvement of a possessive particle (P.P.) ''ti<sup>5</sup>''. For example:

{{interlinear|lang=jig|number=ex:
|jaːn1 ndaːu1 ti5 bo4 
|house/family 1PL POSS.PTCL buffalo
|"Our family's buffalo" }}
(cf. the more common ''bo<sup>4</sup> jaːn<sup>1</sup> ndaːu<sup>1</sup>)'' (Lu 2008:173-174).<ref name="Lu" />

==Writing system==
The Maonan writing system was established in 2010. It is based on 26 Latin letters to facilitate standard keyboard input.<ref>Maonan website: http://maonan.org/wenzi/HagLeaMauhnanh.asp?boardid=24</ref> The letters ''z, j, x, s, h'' are attached to the end of each syllable as tonal markers, representing tones 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively. The first tone is not written. Syllables ending in -b, -d, -g, -p, -t, -k do not distinguish tone either. The writing system is being used among a limited number of Maonan intellectuals.<ref>Maonan website: http://maonan.org/wenzi/shengdiao.asp</ref> For example:

{{interlinear|number=ex:|lang=jig|glossing3=yes
|'''{{noitalic|Writing}}''': Hez suen ngz nhieij hux gangs deih tuet mad
|'''{{abbr|IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet}}''': ɦe² suːn¹ ŋ² ˀnjai³ ɦu⁴ kaːŋ⁵ dai⁶ tuːt⁷' maːt⁸'
|'''Gloss:''' 1SG teach 2SG buy rice stitch bag {take off} sock
|'''Meaning''': "I teach you (how) to buy rice, stitch bags and take off (your) socks."}}
