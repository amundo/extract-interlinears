'''Navajo''' or '''Navaho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|v|ə|h|oʊ|,_|ˈ|n|ɑː|-}};<ref>{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}</ref> Navajo: {{lang|nv|Diné bizaad}} {{IPA-nv|tìnépìz̥ɑ̀ːt|}} or {{lang|nv|Naabeehó bizaad}} {{IPA-nv|nɑ̀ːpèːhópìz̥ɑ̀ːt|}}) is a [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Southern Athabaskan language]] of the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené family]], through which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of [[North America]]. Navajo is spoken primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]], especially on the [[Navajo Nation]]. It is one of the most widely spoken [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Northern America|Native American language]]s and is the most widely spoken north of the [[Mexico–United States border]], with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011. The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation.

The language has a fairly large phoneme inventory; it includes several uncommon consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowels are distinguished for [[Nasal vowel|nasality]], [[Vowel length|length]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It has both [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[fusional language|fusional]] elements: it relies on affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic [[word order]] is [[subject–object–verb]], though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors. Verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], and given affixes for the person and number of both [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]], as well as a host of other variables.

The language's orthography, which was developed in the late 1930s after a series of prior attempts, is based on the [[Latin script]]. Most Navajo vocabulary is Athabaskan in origin, as the language has been conservative with [[loanwords]] since its early stages.

==Nomenclature==

The word ''Navajo'' is an [[exonym]]: it comes from the [[Tewa language|Tewa]] word {{lang|tew|Navahu}}, which combines the roots {{lang|tew|nava}} ('field') and {{lang|tew|hu}} ('valley') to mean 'large field'. It was borrowed into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to refer to an area of present-day northwestern [[New Mexico]], and later into English for the [[Navajo]] tribe and their language.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0 |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=August 1, 2014 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=Navajo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810035022/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Navajo&allowed_in_frame=0 |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The alternative spelling ''Navaho'' is considered antiquated; even anthropologist [[Berard Haile]] spelled it with a "j" in accordance with contemporary usage despite his personal objections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bahr|2004|p=xxxv}}</ref> The Navajo refer to themselves as the {{lang|nv|Diné}} ('People'), with their language known as {{lang|nv|Diné bizaad}} ('People's language')<ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|2013|p=260}}</ref> or {{lang|nv|Naabeehó bizaad}}.

==Classification==
Navajo is an [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]]; Navajo and Apache languages make up the southernmost branch of the family. Most of the other Athabaskan languages are located in Alaska, northwestern Canada, and along the North American Pacific coast.

Most languages in the Athabaskan family have [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; [[Athabaskan languages#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabaskan]] had no tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=139}}</ref> In each case, tone evolved from [[glottalic consonant]]s at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=138}}</ref> Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=333}}</ref>

Navajo is most closely related to [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], with which it shares a similar tonal scheme<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=209}}</ref> and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary. It is estimated that the [[Apache]]an linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525.<ref>{{Harvnb|Levy|1998|p=25}}</ref> As a member of the Western Apachean group, Navajo's closest relative is the [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=334}}</ref> Navajo is generally considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with all other Apachean languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=9}}</ref>

The Apachean languages, of which Navajo is one, are thought to have arrived in the American Southwest from the north by 1500, probably passing through Alberta and Wyoming.<ref>Perry, R. J. (1980). "The Apachean Transition from the Subarctic to the Southwest". ''The Plains Anthropologist'', 279–296.</ref><ref>Brugge, D. M. (1983). "Navajo prehistory and history to 1850". ''Handbook of North American Indians'', 10, 489–501.</ref> Archaeological finds considered to be proto-Navajo have been located in the far northern New Mexico around the La Plata, Animas and Pine rivers, dating to around 1500. In 1936, linguist [[Edward Sapir]] showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *''dè:'', which in Proto-Athabaskan meant "horn" and "dipper made from animal horn", in Navajo came to mean "gourd" or "dipper made from gourd". Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *''ɫ-yáxs'' "snow lies on the ground" in Navajo became ''sàs'' "corn lies on the ground". Similarly, the Navajo word for "corn" is ''nà:-dą:'', derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning "enemy" and "food", suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be "food of the enemy" when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.<ref>Sapir, E. (1936). "Internal linguistic evidence suggestive of the northern origin of the Navaho". ''American Anthropologist'', 38(2), 224–235.</ref><ref>Shaul, D. L. (2014).

===Navajo Code===
During World War II, the United States of America government used a code based on the Navajo language to use as secret communication. These [[code talker]]s would relay secret messages using the code. At the end of the war the code remained unbroken.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.gov/index.php/people/barrier-breakers-in-history/453-navajo-code-talkers#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Marines%20knew%20where,key%20phrases%20and%20military%20tactics.|title=1942: Navajo Code Talkers}}</ref> The code worked by assigning Navajo words to common military phrases. The code proved for the most part effective for conveying secrecy, as the Navajo language was often not learned by spies attempting to break American codes.

===Colonization and decline===
[[File:Navaho-enlistment-letter-page01.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Clayton Barney Vogel]]'s recommendation letter for Navajo to be used by [[code talker]]s during [[World War II]]]]
Navajo lands were initially colonized by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the early nineteenth century, shortly after this area was "annexed" as part of the Spanish colony of [[Mexico]]. When the United States annexed these territories in 1848 following the [[Mexican–American War]],<ref name="Minahan 2013 261"/> the English-speaking settlers allowed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to [[acculturate]] the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|title=The Warrior Tradition &#124; The Warrior Tradition|via=www.pbs.org|access-date=2020-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115052715/https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|archive-date=2019-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.<ref name="Johansen Ritzker 421"/>

[[Robert W. Young]] and William Morgan (Navajo), who both worked for the Navajo Agency of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], developed and published a practical orthography in 1937. It helped spread education among Navajo speakers.<ref name="Minahan 2013 262">{{Harvnb|Minahan|2013|p=262}}</ref> In 1943 the men collaborated on ''The Navajo Language'', a dictionary organized by the roots of the language.<ref name="hargus"/> In [[World War II]], the United States military used speakers of Navajo as [[code talker]]s—to transmit top-secret military messages over telephone and radio in a code based on Navajo. The language was considered ideal because of its grammar, which differs strongly from that of [[German language|German]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and because no published Navajo dictionaries existed at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/us/chester-nez-dies-at-93-his-native-tongue-helped-to-win-a-war-of-words.html?_r=1|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 2014|title=Chester Nez, 93, Dies; Navajo Words Washed From Mouth Helped Win War|last=Fox|first=Margalit|access-date=August 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203623/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/us/chester-nez-dies-at-93-his-native-tongue-helped-to-win-a-war-of-words.html?_r=1|archive-date=August 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite gaining new scholarly attention and being documented, the language declined in use. By the 1960s, indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool—larger than that of any other Native language in the United States—gave it more staying power than most.<ref name="Johansen Ritzker 422">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=422}}</ref> Adding to the language's decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.<ref name="Kroskrity Field 2009 38"/>

===Revitalization and current status===
In 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Bilingual Education Act]], which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers. The Act had mainly been intended for Spanish-speaking children—particularly [[Mexican Americans]]—but it applied to all recognized linguistic minorities. Many Native American tribes seized the chance to establish their own bilingual education programs. However, qualified teachers who were fluent in Native languages were scarce, and these programs were largely unsuccessful.<ref name="Johansen Ritzker 422"/>

However, data collected in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages—early evidence of a resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=8}}</ref> In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, the [[Navajo Nation Council]] decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref name="Johansen Ritzker 422"/> This effort was aided by the fact that, largely due to the work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students. ''The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary'' also included a 400-page grammar, making it invaluable for both native speakers and students of the language. Particularly in its organization of verbs, it was oriented to Navajo speakers.<ref name="kari">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1265203?seq=1 James Kari and Jeff Leer, "Review: ''The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary'' by Robert W.

The Native American language education movement has been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on [[standardized test]]s than their counterparts educated only in English. Some educators have remarked that students who know their native languages feel a sense of pride and identity validation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|pp=423–424}}</ref> Since 1989, [[Diné College]], a Navajo tribal [[community college]], has offered an [[associate degree]] in the subject of Navajo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Elinek|1996|p=376}}</ref> This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States.

A 1991 survey of 682 preschoolers on the Navajo Reservation [[Head Start program]] found that 54 percent were monolingual English speakers, 28 percent were bilingual in English and Navajo, and 18 percent spoke only Navajo. This study noted that while the preschool staff knew both languages, they spoke English to the children most of the time. In addition, most of the children's parents spoke to the children in English more often than in Navajo. The study concluded that the preschoolers were in "almost total immersion in English".<ref>{{Harvnb|Platero|Hinton|2001|pp=87–97}}</ref> An [[American Community Survey]] taken in 2011 found that 169,369 Americans spoke Navajo at home—0.3 percent of Americans whose primary home language was not English. Of primary Navajo speakers, 78.8 percent reported they spoke English "very well", a fairly high percentage overall but less than among other Americans speaking a different Native American language (85.4 percent). Navajo was the only Native American language afforded its own category in the survey; domestic Navajo speakers represented 46.4 percent of all domestic Native language speakers (only 195,407 Americans have a different home Native language).<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Language Use|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf|publisher=Census.gov|date=August 2013|last=Ryan|first=Camille|access-date=August 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205101044/http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf|archive-date=February 5, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As of July 2014, [[Ethnologue]] classes Navajo as "6b" (In Trouble), signifying that few, but some, parents teach the language to their offspring and that concerted efforts at revitalization could easily protect the language.

===Education===
The Navajo Nation operates Tséhootsooí Diné Bi'ólta', a Navajo language immersion school for grades K-8 in [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]]. Located on the Arizona-New Mexico border in the southeastern quarter of the [[Navajo Reservation]], the school strives to revitalize Navajo among children of the [[Window Rock Unified School District]]. Tséhootsooí Diné Bi'ólta' has thirteen Navajo language teachers who instruct only in the Navajo language, and no English, while five English language teachers instruct in the English language. Kindergarten and first grade are taught completely in the Navajo language, while English is incorporated into the program during third grade, when it is used for about 10% of instruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tséhootsooí Diné Bi'óta' Navaho Immersion School|url=http://ourmothertongues.org/language/Navajo/8|access-date=15 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905223432/http://ourmothertongues.org/language/Navajo/8|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Navajo also has a simple [[glottal stop]] used after vowels,<ref name="Kozak 2013 162">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=162}}</ref> and every word that would otherwise begin with a vowel is pronounced with an initial glottal stop.<ref name="Faltz 1998 3">{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|p=3}}</ref> Consonant clusters are uncommon, aside from frequent placing {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} before [[fricative consonant|fricatives]].<ref name="McDonough 2003 5">{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=5}}</ref>

The language has four vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}.<ref name="McDonough 2003 5"/> Each exists in both oral and [[nasal vowel|nasalized]] forms, and can be either short or long.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|pp=6–7}}</ref> Navajo also distinguishes for [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] between high and low, with the low tone typically regarded as the default. However, some linguists have suggested that Navajo does not possess true tones, but only a [[pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] system similar to that of [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Yip|2002|p=239}}</ref> In general, Navajo speech also has a slower [[speech tempo]] than English does.<ref name="Kozak 2013 162"/>

==Grammar==
{{main|Navajo grammar}}

===Typology===
Navajo is difficult to classify in terms of broad [[morphological typology]]: it relies heavily on [[affix]]es—mainly prefixes—like [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] languages,<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=841}}</ref> but these affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult to segment, a trait of [[fusional language|fusional]] languages.<ref name="Mithun 323">{{Harvnb|Mithun|2001|p=323}}</ref> In general, Navajo verbs contain more morphemes than nouns do (on average, 11 for verbs compared to 4–5 for nouns), but noun morphology is less transparent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowerman|Levinson|2001|p=239}}</ref> Depending on the source, Navajo is either classified as a fusional<ref name="Mithun 323"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Sloane|2001|p=442}}</ref> agglutinative or even [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] language, as it shows mechanisms from all three.<ref name="Johansen Ritzker 421">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=421}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bowerman|Levinson|2001|p=238}}</ref>

In terms of basic [[word order]], Navajo has been classified as a [[subject–object–verb]] language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/valuesets/81A-nav|publisher=WALS|access-date=September 1, 2014|title=Datapoint Navajo / Order of Subject, Object and Verb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826121256/http://wals.info/valuesets/81A-nav|archive-date=August 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Tomlin|first=Russell S.|title=Basic Word Order: Functional Principles|year=2014|journal=Routledge Library Editions Linguistics B: Grammar|page=115}}</ref> However, some speakers order the subject and object based on "noun ranking". In this system, nouns are ranked in three categories—humans, animals, and inanimate objects—and within these categories, nouns are ranked by strength, size, and intelligence. Whichever of the subject and object has a higher rank comes first. As a result, the agent of an action may be syntactically ambiguous.<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 902 903">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|pp=902–903}}</ref> The highest rank position is held by humans and lightning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1987|pp=85–86}}</ref> Other linguists such as [[Eloise Jelinek]] consider Navajo to be a [[Non-configurational language|discourse configurational language]], in which word order is not fixed by syntactic rules, but determined by pragmatic factors in the communicative context.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fernald|Platero|2000|pp=252–287}}</ref>

===Verbs===
In Navajo, verbs are the main elements of their sentences, imparting a large amount of information. The verb is based on a [[stem (linguistics)|stem]], which is made of a [[root (linguistics)|root]] to identify the action and the semblance of a suffix to convey [[grammatical mood|mode]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]; however, this suffix is fused beyond separability.<ref name="byu">{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf|publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]|title=A Computational Analysis of Navajo Verb Stems|author1=Eddington, David|author2=Lachler, Jordan|access-date=August 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005548/http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The stem is given somewhat more transparent prefixes to indicate, in this order, the following information: postpositional object, postposition, adverb-state, [[iterativity]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[direct object]], [[deictic]] information, another adverb-state, mode and aspect, subject, classifier (see later on), [[mirativity]] and two-tier [[evidentiality]]. Some of these prefixes may be null; for example, there is only a plural marker (''da/daa'') and no readily identifiable marker for the other grammatical numbers.<ref name="McDonough 2003 21 22"/>

Navajo does not distinguish strict [[grammatical tense|tense]] ''per se''; instead, an action's position in time is conveyed through mode, aspect, but also via time adverbials or context. Each verb has an inherent aspect and can be conjugated in up to seven modes.<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 868">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=868}}</ref> These forms are as follows:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
'''Modes:'''
* Imperfective – an incomplete action; can be used in past, present, or future time frames<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=863}}</ref>
* Perfective – a complete action; usually signifying the [[past tense]] but also applied to future states (e.g. "he will have gone")<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=864}}</ref>
* Usitative – a usual or typical action<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 865">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=865}}</ref>
* Iterative – a recurrent or repetitive action; often used interchangeably with the usitative<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 865"/>
* Progressive – ongoing action; unlike the imperfective, the focus is more on the progression across space or time than incompleteness<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 866">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=866}}</ref>
* Future – a prospective action, analogous to the [[future tense]]<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 866"/>
* Optative – a potential or desired action, similar to the [[subjunctive mood]] of Indo-European languages<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 866"/>

{{col-2}}
'''Aspects:'''
* Momentaneous – an action that takes place at a specific point in time<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 868"/>
* Continuative – an action that covers an indefinite timeframe, without a specific beginning, goal, or even temporal direction<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 868"/>
* Durative – similar to the continuative, but not covering locomotion verbs<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 868"/>
* Conclusive – similar to the durative, but emphasizing the completed nature of the action when in the perfective mode<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 869">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=869}}</ref>
* Repetitive – an action that is repeated in some way, dependent on the sub-aspect and sub-sub-aspect type used<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|pp=869–870}}</ref>
* Semelfactive – an action that is distinguished from a connected group or series of actions<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=870}}</ref>
* Distributive – an action that occurs among a group of targets or locations<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 871">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=871}}</ref>
* Diversative – an action that occurs "here and there", among an unspecified group of targets or locations<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 871"/>
* Reversative – an action involving change in physical or metaphorical direction<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 872">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=872}}</ref>
* Conative – an action the subject attempts to perform<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 873">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=873}}</ref>
* Transitional – an action involving transition from one status or form to another<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 873"/>
* Cursive – an action of moving in a straight line in space or time<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 873"/>
{{col-end}}

For any verb, the usitative and repetitive modes share the same stem, as do the progressive and future modes; these modes are distinguished with prefixes. However, pairs of modes other than these may also share the same stem,<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|p=18}}</ref> as illustrated in the following example, where the verb "to play" is conjugated into each of the five mode paradigms:
* Imperfective: ''-né'' – is playing, was playing, will be playing
* Perfective: ''-neʼ'' – played, had played, will have played
* Progressive/future: ''-neeł'' – is playing along / will play, will be playing
* Usitative/repetitive: ''-neeh'' – usually plays, frequently plays, repeatedly plays
* Optative: ''-neʼ'' – would play, may play
The basic set of subject prefixes for the imperfective mode, as well as the actual conjugation of the verb into these person and number categories, are as follows.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=21–22}}</ref>

The remaining piece of these conjugated verbs—the prefix ''na-''—is called an "outer" or "disjunct" prefix. It is the marker of the Continuative aspect (to play about).<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=12–13}}</ref>

Navajo distinguishes between the first, second, third, and fourth persons in the singular, dual, and plural numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|p=21}}</ref> The fourth person is similar to the third person, but is generally used for indefinite, theoretical actors rather than defined ones.<ref name="harder">{{cite journal|title=On the use of the fourth person in Navajo, or Navajo made harder|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|last1=Akmajian|first1=Adrian|last2=Anderson|first2=Stephen|volume=36|number=1|date=January 1970|pages=1–8|doi=10.1086/465082|s2cid=143473426}}</ref> Despite the potential for extreme verb complexity, only the mode/aspect, subject, classifier, and stem are absolutely necessary.<ref name="McDonough 2003 21 22">{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|pp=21–22}}</ref> Furthermore, Navajo negates clauses by surrounding the verb with the circum[[clitic]] ''doo= ... =da'' (e.g. ''mósí doo nitsaa da'' 'the cat is not big'). ''Dooda'', as a single word, corresponds to English ''no''.<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 882">{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=882}}</ref>

[[Navajo grammar#Classificatory verbs|Classificatory verbs]] are a set of verbal roots distinguishing eleven shapes and three classes of motion for each shape.<ref name="Christiansen 2009 185 186">{{Harvnb|Christiansen|2009|pp=185–186}}</ref><ref name="Beck 2006 374 375">{{Harvnb|Beck|2006|pp=374–375}}</ref> The motion classes are:
* handle: movement of an object by continuing physical contact throughout the movement (take, bring, carry, lower, attach,...)
* propel: movement of an object by propulsion (throw, toss, drop,...)
* free flight: movement of a subject of its own without causative agent (fly, fall,...)

The shapes are listed here with their standard names and their corresponding ''handle'' root.<ref name="Christiansen 2009 185 186"/>
{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
* Solid Roundish Objects (-ą́): apple, coin,...
* Load, Pack, Burden (-yį́): furniture, large body of water...
* Non-Compact Matter (-ł-jool): hay, wig,...
* Slender Flexible Object (-lá): rope, belt, but also dual objects like gloves,..

{{col-3}}
* Slender Stiff Object (-tą́): stick, pen,...
* Flat Flexible Object (-ł-tsooz): sheet, paper,...
* Mushy Matter (-tłééʼ): butter, mud, frog,...
* Plural Objects 1 (-nil): severality of objects
{{col-3}}
* Plural Objects 2 (-jaaʼ): profusion of small objects like seeds,...
* Open Container (-ką́): water in a bottle, seeds in a box, snow in a truck,...
* Animate Object (-ł-tį́): person, doll,...
{{col-end}}
For example, Navajo has no single verb that corresponds to the English 'give'. To say 'give me some hay', the Navajo verb ''níłjool'' (Non-Compact Matter) must be used, while for 'give me a cigarette' the verb ''nítįįh'' (Slender Stiff Object) must be used.
Navajo also contains a separate system of [[Navajo grammar#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifiers]] that generally marks for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]]. There are four classifiers: ''Ø-'', ''[[wikt:ł-#Navajo|ł-]]'', ''[[wikt:d-#Navajo|d-]]'', and ''[[wikt:l-#Navajo|l-]]'', placed between the personal prefixes and the verbal stem. The ''ł-'' classifier indicates causation (transitivity increase), e.g. ''yibéézh'' (''yi-Ø-béézh'') 'it's boiling' vs. ''yiłbéézh'' (''yi-ł-béézh'') 'he's boiling it'. The ''d-'' and ''l-'' classifiers indicate passive voice (transitivity reduction), e.g. ''yizéés'' (''yi-Ø-zéés'') 'he's singing it' vs. ''yidéés'' (''yi-d-zéés'') 'it's being sung' . The ''d-'' classifier is used to detransitivize verbs with ''Ø-'', while ''l-'' is used for verbs with ''ł-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=40–41}}</ref>

===Nouns===
Nouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with [[grammatical gender]] may repeatedly use pronouns.<ref name="Kozak 2013 161">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=161}}</ref>

Most nouns are not inflected for number,<ref name="Young Morgan 1992 882"/> and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory. In the following example, the verb on the right is used with the plural prefix ''da-'' and switches to the distributive aspect.

<blockquote>
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes
|Kin áshłééh.
|kin á-{{gcl|Ø|empty morpheme}}-sh-łééh
|house make-3.OBJ-1.SUBJ-make.MOM.{{gcl|IMPF|imperfective mode}}

{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes

|house make-'''PL'''-3.OBJ-1.SUBJ-make.'''{{gcl|DIST|distributive aspect}}'''.{{gcl|IMPF|imperfective mode}}
|'I build houses.'}}
{{col-end}}
</blockquote>

Some verbal roots encode number in their lexical definition (see classificatory verbs above). When available, the use of the correct verbal root is mandatory:

<blockquote>
{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv
|Béégashii sitį́.

|Béégashii shitéézh.
|cow 3.SUBJ-lie({{gcl|2|two subjects}}).{{gcl|PERF|perfective mode}}
|'The (two) cows lie.'}}
{{col-3}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv
|Béégashii shijééʼ.
|cow 3.SUBJ-lie({{gcl|3+|three or more subjects}}).{{gcl|PERF|perfective mode}}
|'The (three or more) cows lie.'}}
{{col-end}}

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes
|Bilasáana shaa niʼaah.
|bilasáana sh-aa {{gcl|Ø|empty morpheme}}-ni-ʼaah
|apple 1-to 3.OBJ-2.SUBJ-give({{gcl|SRO|Solid Roundish Object}}).MOM.{{gcl|PERF|perfective mode}}
|'You give me an apple.'}}
{{col-2}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv| glossing3=yes
|Bilasáana shaa ninííł.
|bilasáana sh-aa {{gcl|Ø|empty morpheme}}-ni-nííł
|apple 1-to 3.OBJ-2.SUBJ-give({{gcl|PlO1|Plural Object 1}}).MOM.{{gcl|PERF|perfective mode}}
|'You give me apples.'}}
{{col-end}}
</blockquote>

Number marking on nouns occurs only for terms of kinship and age-sex groupings. Other prefixes that can be added to nouns include possessive markers (e.g. ''chidí'' 'car' – ''shichidí'' 'my car') and a few adjectival enclitics. Generally, an upper limit for prefixes on a noun is about four or five.<ref name="Mueller 2008 12"/>

Nouns are also not marked for [[grammatical case|case]], this traditionally being covered by word order.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speas|1990|p=203}}</ref>

<blockquote>
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
{{interlinear| lang = nv
|Atʼééd ashkii yiyiiłtsą́.

Other parts of speech in Navajo are also relatively immutable, and tend to be short. These parts of speech include question particles, demonstrative adjectives, [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|pp=934–943}}</ref> and [[adverb]]s (both unique ones and those based on verbs).<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|pp=944–945}}</ref> The Navajo numeral system is [[decimal]], and some example numbers follow.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|pp=932–933}}</ref>

Navajo does not contain a single part of speech analogous to [[adjective]]s; rather, some verbs describe static qualitative attributes (e.g. ''[[wikt:nitsaa|nitsaa]]'' 'he/she/it is large'), and demonstrative adjectives (e.g. ''[[wikt:díí|díí]]'' 'this/these') are their own part of speech. However, these verbs, known as "neuter verbs", are distinguished by only having the imperfective mode, as they describe continuous states of being.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=934}}</ref>

==Vocabulary==
The vast majority of Navajo vocabulary is of Athabaskan origin.<ref name="Wurm 1996 1134"/> However, the vocabulary size is still fairly small; one estimate counted 6,245 noun bases and 9,000 verb bases, with most of these nouns being derived from verbs.<ref name="Mueller 2008 12">{{Harvnb|Mueller-Gathercole|2008|p=12}}</ref> Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]], Navajo did not borrow much from other languages, including from other Athabaskan and even [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Apachean]] languages. The Athabaskan family is fairly diverse in both [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] due to its languages' prolonged relative isolation.<ref name="Wurm 1996 1134">{{Harvnb|Wurm|Mühlhäusler|Tyron|1996|p=1134}}</ref> Even the [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo peoples]], with whom the Navajo interacted with for centuries and borrowed cultural customs, have lent few words to the Navajo language. After Spain and Mexico took over Navajo lands, the language did not incorporate many [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, either.<ref name="Kroskrity Field 2009 39">{{Harvnb|Kroskrity|Field|2009|p=39}}</ref>

This resistance to word absorption extended to English, at least until the mid-twentieth century. Around this point, the Navajo language began importing some, though still not many, English words, mainly by young schoolchildren exposed to English.<ref name="Kroskrity Field 2009 38">{{Harvnb|Kroskrity|Field|2009|p=38}}</ref>

Navajo has expanded its vocabulary to include Western technological and cultural terms through [[calque]]s and Navajo descriptive terms. For example, the phrase for English ''[[tank]]'' is ''[[wikt:chidí naaʼnaʼí beeʼeldǫǫhtsoh bikááʼ dah naaznilígíí|chidí naa'naʼí beeʼeldǫǫhtsoh bikááʼ dah naaznilígíí]]'' 'vehicle that crawls around, by means of which big explosions are made, and that one sits on at an elevation'. This [[language purism]] also extends to proper nouns, such as the names of U.S. states (e.g. ''Hoozdo'' 'Arizona' and ''Yootó'' 'New Mexico'; see also ''hahoodzo'' 'state') and languages (''naakaii'' 'Spanish').

Only one Navajo word has been fully absorbed into the English language: ''[[hogan]]'' (from Navajo ''hooghan'') – a term referring to the traditional houses.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date=August 6, 2014|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=hogan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811164422/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Another word with limited English recognition is ''[[chindi]]'' (an evil spirit of the deceased).<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=165}}</ref> The [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[genus]] name ''[[Side-blotched lizard|Uta]]'' may be of Navajo origin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=211}}</ref> It has been speculated that English-speaking settlers were reluctant to take on more Navajo loanwords compared to [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas|many other Native American languages]], including the [[Hopi language]], because the Navajo were among the most violent resisters to colonialism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=110}}</ref>

==Orthography==
Early attempts at a Navajo orthography were made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One such attempt was based on the [[Latin alphabet]], particularly the [[English alphabet|English variety]], with some additional letters and diacritics. Anthropologists were frustrated by Navajo's having several sounds that are not found in English and lack of other sounds that are.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bahr|2004|pp=33–34}}</ref> Finally, the current Navajo orthography was developed between 1935 and 1940<ref name="Minahan 2013 262"/> by Young and Morgan.

An apostrophe (ʼ) is used to mark ejective consonants (e.g. ''chʼ'', ''tłʼ'')<ref name="Faltz 1998 5">{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|p=5}}</ref> as well as mid-word or final glottal stops. However, initial glottal stops are usually not marked.<ref name="Faltz 1998 3"/> The [[voiceless glottal fricative]] ({{IPA|/h/}}) is normally written as ''h'', but appears as ''x'' after the consonants ''s'', ''z'', and digraphs ending in ''h'' to avoid phonological ambiguity.<ref name="Faltz 1998 5"/><ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=85}}</ref> The [[voiced velar fricative]] is written as ''y'' before ''i'' and ''e'' (where it is palatalized {{IPA|/ʝ/}}), as ''w'' before ''o'' (where it is labialized {{IPA|/ɣʷ/}}), and as ''gh'' before ''a''.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDonough|2003|p=160}}</ref>

Navajo represents nasalized vowels with an [[ogonek]] ( ˛ ), sometimes described as a reverse [[cedilla]]; and represents the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|/ɬ/}}) with a barred ''L'' (capital ''Ł'', lowercase ''ł'').<ref name="Spolsky 2009 86">{{Harvnb|Spolsky|2009|p=86}}</ref> The ogonek is placed centrally under a vowel, but it was imported from [[Polish orthography|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], which do not use it under certain vowels such as ''o'' or any vowels with accent marks. For example, in proper Navajo writing, the ogonek below lowercase ''a'' is written centered below the letter,{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} whereas fonts for ''a'' with ogonek intended for Polish and Lithuanian such as those used in common Web browsers render the ogonek connected to the bottom right of the letter. {{As of|2017|post=,}} no Unicode font has been developed to properly accommodate Navajo typography. Google is working to correct this oversight with [[Noto fonts]].

The first Navajo-capable [[typewriter]] was developed in preparation for a Navajo newspaper and dictionary created in the 1940s. The advent of early computers in the 1960s necessitated special fonts to input Navajo text, and the first Navajo font was created in the 1970s.<ref name="Spolsky 2009 86"/> Navajo [[virtual keyboard]]s were made available for [[iOS]] devices in November 2012 and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/12/navajo-keyboard-available-android-devices-151252|publisher=Indian Country (Today Media Network)|date=September 12, 2013|title=Navajo Keyboard Now Available on Android Devices!|access-date=August 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195238/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/12/navajo-keyboard-available-android-devices-151252|archive-date=May 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
