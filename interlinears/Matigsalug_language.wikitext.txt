'''Matigsalug''' (Matig-Salug Manobo) is a [[Manobo languages|Manobo language]] of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]]. It belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. 

==Distribution and dialects==
There are approximately at least 50,000 speakers of the language, most of whom are concentrated in [[Mindanao]], notably in south central [[Bukidnon]], north-northeastern [[Cotabato]] and northwestern [[Davao del sur|Davao del Sur]] provinces.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manobo, Matigsalug |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mbt |access-date=2020-12-30 |website=Ethnologue |language=en}}</ref> A total of 5,000 monolingual speakers of the language has been reported.

Matigsalug can be divided into four major dialects: Kulamanen, Tigwa, Tala Ingod, and Matigsalug Proper. Dialects are divergent, such that Tigwa has marginal intelligibility of Matigsalug, and only Tala Ingod may have adequate intelligibility of Matigsalug.

==Writing system==
Matigsalug is typically written using eighteen graphemes: a, b, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, w, and y. The graphemes c, f, j, o, q, v, x, and z are used in recently borrowed words and the names of people and places. The glottal stop is represented by a hyphen when it occurs word medially, but not where it occurs intervocalically. For example, the word [manʔʌʔ] 'again' is written as ''man-e'', while the word [tiʔaŋ] 'carry on the shoulder' is written as ''tiang''.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Matigsalug has four vowels:<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=P. |date=1991 |title=The phonemics and morphophonemics of Matig-Salug Manobo. |journal=Philippine Journal of Linguistics |language=en |volume=22 |issue=1-2 |pages=1-29}}</ref> /i, ʌ, a, u/.

Long vowels do occur in Matigsalug, albeit rarely. The orthographic convention for long vowels is to write two vowel segments. For example, the word [pa:n] 'bread' is written as ''paan''. This is in contrast with the spelling convention of most other Philippine languages, where sequences of identical vowels are separated by a glottal stop, e.g. Tagalog ''saan'' ([sa'ʔan]).

===Consonants===

There are 14 Matigsalug consonants. All the stops are unaspirated. The [[velar nasal]] occurs in all positions including at the beginning of a word.

===Stress===
Stress in Matigsalug always occurs penultimately, that is, on the second-to-last vowel. Because it is completely predictable, stress is not marked orthographically.

Matigsalug does have small one-syllable [[clitic]]s. When these phonologically join to the previous word, they cause the stress to shift in order to maintain penultimate stress. For example, the word for 'father' is ''ámey''; when the possessive determiner ''rin'' 'his/her' is added, the stress shifts to the second syllable of the word for 'father': ''améy rin''

==Morphosyntax==

===Noun phrases===
Nouns are preceded by a case marker. There are three types of case markers in Matigsalug.

First, similar to the better-studied ''ang''-marking in Tagalog, the language also employs a case-marking reserved for the noun with which the verb agrees (via focus/voice morphology). This marker exhibits allomorphy depending on whether the noun is a proper noun or a common noun. ''Si'' is the allomorph used when the noun is a proper noun or a kinship term; ''ka'' is used when the noun is a common noun or a possessive noun phrase.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|si Inday/Anggam
|Focus Inday/uncle
|'Inday/Uncle'}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ka {tirè/geyinawa rin}
|Focus {sugar cane/breath his}
|'the sugar cane/his breath'}}

Second, when the verb shows agreement with any other noun other than the agent/experiencer, the agent/experiencer is marked with a separate case marking. In other words, this would be comparable with the by-phrase in an English passive. This case marking also exhibits allomorphy depending on whether the agent/experiencer is a proper or a common noun. ''Ni'' is the allomorph used when the noun is a proper noun or a kinship term; ''te'' is used when the noun is a common noun or a possessive noun phrase.	

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ni Inday/Anggam
|NonFocus(Ag) Inday/uncle
|'by Inday/uncle'}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|te lukes
|NonFocus(Ag) man
|'by the man'}}

Lastly, there is case marking reserved for non-focused non-agent/experiencer roles in the clause. This case marking also exhibits allomorphy depending on whether the agent/experiencer is a proper or a common noun. ''Ki'' is the allomorph used when the noun is a proper noun or a kinship term; ''te'' is used when the noun is a common noun or a possessive noun phrase.	

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ki Inday/Anggam
|NonFocus Inday/uncle
|'to/from Inday/uncle'}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|te lukes
|NonFocus man
|'to/from the man'}}

===Focus/voice morphology===
Characteristic of Philippine-type languages, Matigsalug verbs carry what is known in the literature as  [[Austronesian alignment|focus morphology]]. This piece of morphology indicates the semantic roles of the participants in the clause with respect to the verb. Matigsalug can put the agent/experiencer (AF), goal (GF), location (LF), and instrument (IF) into direct focus.

In the first example, the prefix ''eg''- indicates that the ''ka''-marked noun functions as the agent, that is, the entity doing the kicking. In the second example, the prefix ''eg''- in combination with the suffix ''-en'' together indicate that the ''ka''-marked noun is the goal, that is, the entity being kicked.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Egsipè ka kuddè te kuddè
|NonPast-kick-Agent Focus horse NonFocus child
|'The horse kicks the child'}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Egsipeen ka kuddè te kuddè
|NonPast-kick-Agent Focus horse NonFocus(Ag) child
|'The child kicks the horse'}}
