'''Yurok''' (also '''Chillula''', '''Mita''', '''Pekwan''', '''Rikwa''', '''Sugon''', '''Weitspek''', '''Weitspekan''') is an [[Algic languages|Algic language]].<ref>Campbell (1997:152)</ref> It is the traditional language of the [[Yurok]] people of [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte County]] and [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]] on the far north coast of [[California]], most of whom now speak [[English language|English]]. The last native speaker died in 2013.<ref name="romney" /> As of 2012, Yurok language classes were taught to high school students, and other [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] efforts were expected to increase the population of speakers.<ref>Atherton (2010)</ref>

The standard reference on the Yurok language grammar is by [[R. H. Robins]] (1958).<ref name=robins>[[R. H. Robins|Robins, Robert H.]] 1958. [https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_yur_book-1 The Yurok Language: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon]. University of California Publications in Linguistics 15.</ref>

==Name==
Concerning the etymology of "Yurok" ({{a.k.a.}} ''Weitspekan''), this below is from Campbell (1997):

{{quote|''Yurok'' is from Karuk ''yúruk'' meaning literally 'downriver'. The Yurok traditional name for themselves is ''Puliklah'' (Hinton 1994:157), from ''pulik'' 'downstream' + ''-la'' 'people of', thus equivalent in meaning to the Karuk name by which they came to be known in English (Victor Golla, personal communication).<cite>(Campbell 1997:401, notes #131 & 132)</cite>}}

==History==
Decline of the language began during the [[California Gold Rush]], due to the influx of new settlers and [[Native American disease and epidemics|the diseases they brought with them]]. [[Native American boarding schools]] initiated by the United States government with the intent of [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|incorporating the native populations]] of America into mainstream American society increased the rate of decline of the language.<ref>{{Cite web| title = The Yurok Tribe Home Page| access-date = 2014-05-07| url=http://www.yuroktribe.org/culture/culture.htm}}</ref>

==Current status==
The program to revive Yurok has been lauded as the most successful language revitalization program in [[California]].<ref name="leeromney">Romney, Lee. (2013, February 6). ''[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-yurok-language-20130207,0,776112.story Revival of nearly extinct Yurok language is a success story]''. The Los Angeles Times. Retrieved February 7, 2013</ref> As of 2014, there are six schools in Northern California that teach Yurok - four high schools and two elementary schools. Rick Jordan, principal of Eureka High School, one of the schools with a Yurok Language Program, remarks on the impact that schools can have on the vitality of a language, "A hundred years ago, it was our organizations that were beating the language out of folks, and now we're trying to re-instill it - a little piece of something that is much larger than us".<ref name="Onishi">{{Cite news

The last known native, active speaker of Yurok, [[Archie Thompson (Yurok)|Archie Thompson]], died March 26, 2013. "He was also the last of about 20 elders who helped revitalize the language over the last few decades, after academics in the 1990s predicted it would be extinct by 2010. He made recordings of the language that were archived by UC Berkeley linguists and the tribe, spent hours helping to teach Yurok in community and school classrooms, and welcomed apprentice speakers to probe his knowledge."<ref name=romney>{{Cite news

Linguists at [[UC Berkeley]] began the Yurok Language Project in 2001. Professor Andrew Garrett and Dr. [[Juliette Blevins]] collaborated with tribal elders on a Yurok dictionary that has been hailed as a national model.<ref name="leeromney"/> The Yurok Language Project has gone much more in depth than just a printed lexicon, however.  The dictionary is available online and fully searchable. It is also possible to search an audio dictionary - a repository of audio clips of words and short phrases. For a more in depth study, there is a database of compiled texts where words and phrases can be viewed as part of a larger context.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~yurok/web/search.php|title = Yurok Language Project: Advanced Search}}</ref>

As of February 2013, there are over 300 basic Yurok speakers, 60 with intermediate skills, 37 who are advanced, and 17 who are considered conversationally fluent.<ref name="leeromney"/> As of 2014, nine people are certified to teach Yurok in schools. Since Yurok, like many other Native American languages, uses a master-apprentice system to train up speakers in the language, having even nine certified teachers would not be possible without a piece of legislation passed in 2009 in the state of California that allows indigenous tribes the power to appoint their own language teachers.<ref name="Onishi"/>

Notable is the lack of plain /s/.

Yurok has an anticipatory vowel harmony system where underlying non-high vowels /a/, /e/, and /ɔ/ are realized as [ɚ] if they precede an /ɚ/.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yurok|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/yurok.php|website=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|publisher=UC Berkeley|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>

The glottalized approximants {{IPA|/ˀl ˀɻ ˀj ˀw/}} may be realized as [[creaky voice]] on the preceding vowel, a preceding [[glottal stop]], or both. They are often [[voiceless consonant|devoiced]] when they occur at the end of a word.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Yurok has front-, central-, and back-closing diphthongs. The second element of the diphthongs is considered a consonant or semivowel. This is because Yurok diphthongs are falling diphthongs and behave similarly to nasal and approximates following a vowel and preceding a pause or voiceless non-glottalized consonant.<ref name=robins/>

All Yurok Syllables begin with a consonant and contain at least one vowel. Here are some examples of the different kinds of syllable structure:<ref name=robins/>

{|class=wikitable
|-
| CV || {{IPA|ki}} || will, can 
|-
| CV: || {{IPA|hoː}} || to go 
|-

|-

|-
| CV:VC || {{IPA|ʂoːol}} || yew 
|-
| CCV:V || {{IPA|knuːu}} || hawk 
|}

V:V can only be {{IPA|/oːo/}} or {{IPA|/uːu/}} and is signaled by a change in pitch between the vowels.

==Morphology==

Yurok morphological processes include prefixation, infixation, inflection, vowel harmony, ablaut, consonantal alternation,{{clarify|date=February 2014}} and reduplication.<ref name=robins/>

Prefixation and infixation occur in nominals and verbals, and occasionally in other classes, although infixation occurs most frequently in verbals.

[[Vowel harmony]] occurs for prefixes, infixes, and inflections, depending on the vocalic and consonantal structure of the word stem. Internal vocalic alternation involves three alternating pairs: {{IPA|/e/~/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/~/iʔi/}}, {{IPA|/e/~/u/}}.

Reduplication occurs mostly on verb stems but occasionally for nouns and can connote repetition, plurality, etc. Reduplication occurs on the first syllable, and sometimes a part of the second syllable:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! colspan=2 | Stem || colspan=2 | Reduplicated form

| {{IPA|kelomen}} || to turn (trans.) || {{IPA|kekelomen}} || to turn several things

==Tense and aspect==

Tense - Yurok has no way to differentiate tense through verbal inflection. Past, present and future may be inferred through both linguistic and nonlinguistic context.

Aspect - Aspect in Yurok is indicated by preverbal particles. These occur either directly or indirectly before a verb. These can combine with verbs and other particles to indicate time and many other aspects.

Some preverbal particles include: ho (past time); kic (past but with ongoing effects); wo (past after a negative, or in "unreal conditions"); ?ap (past with the implication of starting some action).<ref>The Yurok Language by R. H. Robins</ref>

==Basic syntax==

The most common form of sentence structure consists of a Nominal + Verbal. Indeed, most other, seemingly more complex sentence structures can be viewed as expanding on this fundamental type.<ref>Robins, Robert H. 1958. The Yurok Language: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon. University of California Publications in Linguistics 15.</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|nek   helomey      -ek
|I     {be dancing} -1sg
|I am dancing}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|pu:k   roʔop'
|deer   run
|The deer is running}}

Sentences can also be equational, consisting of two nominals or nominal groups:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|wok        ne-      let
|3SG.PRO    SG.POSS- sister
|That is my sister}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|woʔot    ku  tmi:gomin
|3SG.PRO  ART  hunter
|He is the hunter}}

Sentences can also be composed of one or more verbals without nominals as explicit arguments.

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=INFL:inflection
|tmo:l      -ok'
|{to shoot} -1SG.INFL
|I am shooting}}

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=INFL:inflection
|hoʔop'         -es
|{build a fire} -2SG.IMP.INFL
|Build a fire!}}

The same is true for nominals and nominal groups, which can stand alone as complete sentences, following a similar pattern to the equational sentences already mentioned.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|kwesi twegoh
|ADV   raccoon
|And it was the raccoon}}

Complex sentences are formed along similar principles to these, but with expanded verbals or nominals, or verbals and/or nominals connected by coordinators.

Word order is sometimes used to distinguish between the categories of subject and object.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ku pegək noʔp'eʔn mewiɬ
|the man {to chase} elk
|The man chased the elk.}}

However, if the morphological inflections are sufficiently unambiguous, it is not necessary to maintain a strict word order.

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=INFL:inflection
|nekac new -ohpeʔn ku wencokws
|1SG.OBJ {to see} -3SG.INFL ART woman
|The woman saw me.}}

In the sentences composed of a subject and a verb, the two are often interchangeable.

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=INFL:inflection
|helom      -eʔy      ku  pegək
|{to dance} -3SG.INFL ART man
|The man dances.}}
{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=INFL:inflection
|ku pegək helom -eʔy
|ART man {to dance} -3SG.INFL
|The man dances.}}

== Writing ==
As of 2020, Yurok is written in the New Yurok Alphabet, using Latin characters. Previously, Yurok was written in the [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Unifon_alphabet_-_adaptation_to_Yurok_language.gif/300px-Unifon_alphabet_-_adaptation_to_Yurok_language.gif Yurok Unifon]; some books cited in the Yurok Language Project contain Yurok written in the unifon, though due to practicality in writing, typing, and reading, the Latin characters are now preferred. Currently, there is a spelling reform occurring to streamline the spelling of words; thus, some letters may differ between spellings. Currently, this is the alphabet as taught at various schools.
