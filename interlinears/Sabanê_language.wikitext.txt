The '''Sabanê language''' is one of the three major groups of languages spoken in the [[Nambikwara language|Nambikwara family]]. The groups of people who speak this language were located in the extreme north of the Nambikwara territory in the [[Rondônia]] and [[Mato Grosso]] states of western Brazil, between the [[Tenente Marques River]] and [[Juruena River]].<ref name="Miller">{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/nambikwara/1672|title=Povos Indigenas No Brasil, Instituto Sociambiental|last=Miller|first=Joana.|date=2008|publisher=Instituto Socioambiental}}</ref> Today, most members of the group are found in the Pyreneus de Souza Indigenous Territory in the state of Rondonia.<ref name="Miller"/>

Currently, there are less than 5 native speakers of the Sabanê language, with all the speakers being more than 50 years old.<ref name="Antunes">{{cite book|last=Antunes de Araujo|first= Gabriel|date=2004|title=A Grammar of Sabanê, a Nambikwara Language|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/94_fulltext.pdf|location=The Netherlands|publisher=LOT publications|isbn=9076864594}}</ref> With no apparent transmission level, this language is considered as highly endangered when compared to the other two Nambikwara languages which have higher levels of transmission and preservation.<ref name="Moore">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Moore|first=D.|title=Brazil:Language Situation|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|url=|doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/01855-1}}</ref>

== History ==
Amongst the languages in the Nambikwara family, the Sabanê people have the smallest population size.<ref name="Moore"/> During [[World War II]], many Nambikwara territories suffered from invasions brought about by the search for rubber to supply the war.<ref name="Reesink">{{cite web |url=http://rozenbergquarterly.com/an-introduction-to-three-nambikwara-ethnohistories/|title=An Introduction To Three Nambikwara Ethnohistories|last=Reesink|first=E.B.|date=2010|publisher=Rozenberg Publishers}}</ref> The installation of tappers resulted in the Nambikwara people being forced into hard labour. Many of the Sabanê people were amongst those forced to provide food crops for the tappers. Due to harsh working conditions, many of the Sabanê people tried to flee to the forest, however this action was met with violent retaliation from the tappers who would return them to the village and murder multiple leaders.<ref name="Reesink"/> In addition, Sabanê people suffered from epidemics brought on by contact with the invaders of their land. This led to an immense loss of lives bringing the Sabanê people close to extinction.<ref name="Moore"/>
Around 1930, the arrival of the Jesuit Missionaries in the Cerrado region brought formal education to the Nambikwara region. By the beginning of 1940, there was the first school called “Irmãzinhas da Imaculada Conceição”, where small groups of children learned to read and write. Consequently, with arrival of rubber tappers many roads began to open near the Nambikwara villages, which allowed for the formalization of indigenous education.<ref name="Souza">{{cite web |url=http://www.uel.br/grupo-estudo/processoscivilizadores/portugues/sitesanais/anais14/arquivos/textos/Workshop/Trabalhos_Completos/Ilma_Souza.pdf|title=O povo sabanê e o processo civilizador: algumas reflexões sobre o lugar da educação formal indígena|last=Saramago de Souza|first=Ilma|last2=Bruno|first2=Marilda|date=2012|trans-title=The Sabanê people and the civilizing process: some reflections on the place of formal education|language=pt}}</ref>

== Language Family ==
The Nambikwara linguistic family has no known relationships with any other South American linguistic families. The word Nambikwara, Tupi in origin and meaning pierced ear, was designated to the people occupying the northwest Mato Grosso and the border areas of Rondônia. Along with Sabanê, it includes the Southern and Northern Nambikwara languages. These three branches of Nambikwara further include more than fifteen languages and dialects.<ref name="Antunes"/> Unlike Sabanê, Northern and Southern Nambikwara languages are well preserved with the Southern Nambikwara language having the highest level of transmission, with all its people being speakers of the language.<ref name="Moore"/>

== Linguistic Origins and Literature ==
The first mention of the Sabanê people being described using this very distinction occurred in 1914, in an account from [[Cândido Rondon]], a Brazilian explorer of Indigenous and Portuguese descent, while building a telegraph line through Nambikwaran land.<ref name="Antunes"/> Linguistic documentation did not occur until [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], a philosopher on a French cultural expedition did so in 1948. While there was documentation of the language concerning classification done in 1919 by [[Edgar Roquette-Pinto]], and again in 1948 by Rondon and Faria, these two reports did not include any linguistic details.<ref name="Antunes"/>  Levi-Strauss however created a word list, comprising fifty-six words, and began to describe the morphology and phonology of Sabanê in some detail. Levi-Strauss concluded that it was not possible to determine at that point whether Sabanê belonged to the Nambikwara family given significant morphological and phonological differences with the other Nambikwara languages.<ref name="Antunes"/>  In the following years, Sabanê appeared in some comparative analyses and more developed documentation of the linguistics of Sabanê emerged from this. The most notable of these comparative studies comes from David Price, from the [[University of Brasília]] in 1978, who described the [[phonology]] of Nambikwara languages in comparison to one another.<ref name="Antunes"/>

=== Pedagogical Grammar ===
A comprehensive linguistic description focusing exclusively on Sabanê did not emerge until Gabriel Antunes de Araujo’s ‘A Grammar of Sabanê’, in 2004. Antunes de Araujo is a linguist and professor at the [[University of São Paulo]]. This book includes an extensive description of the phonology, morphology, syntax, adverbs, and interrogative words of the Sabanê language, along with some general historical and cultural information on the Sabanê people. 
Antunes de Araujo’s work remains the most comprehensive and complete documentation of the Sabanê language, and was sponsored by CAPES ([[Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior]]), a body of the Brazilian government, as well as WOTRO, a Dutch organization.<ref name="Antunes"/>  Another notable documentation of the Sabanê language, Levi-Straus’ work, was supported by the French government.<ref name="Antunes"/>

=== Ethnography ===
There have also been some (however very few) ethnographies on the Sabanê people- one of the most prominent being by Edwin Reesink in 2004, that primarily focuses on the cultural implications of names and naming in Sabanê culture, and was also sponsored by WOTRO.<ref name="Reesink"/> This lack of documentation and information tends to be significant for Sabanê culture and language; while it appears in a number of works, it is usually only mentioned with very little information provided.

== Phonology ==
Sabanê has 16 [[phoneme]]s — 11 consonants and 5 vowels. Each has different [[allophone]]s.<ref name="Antunes"/>

=== Consonants ===
Sabanê's 11 consonants are shown in the table below.

{| class="wikitable" style= "text-align: center;"

|
|
|-
!colspan="2"| [[Lateral consonant|Laterals]]

|
|
|}

The consonants used in Sabanê are similar to those for the Northern Nambikwara languages, although there are no implosives in [[Latundê]]. However, the Southern Nambikwara languages have different phonemes such as glottalized and aspirated consonants as wells as only one implosive {{IPAslink|ɗ}} and one affricate {{IPAslink|tʃ}}.<ref name="Antunes"/>

===Vowels===
Sabanê has 5 phonemic vowels, listed in the table below.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{| class='wikitable' style= 'text-align: center;"
|-

! [[Front vowel|Front]]

Once again the vowels used in Sabanê are similar to Northern Nambikwara, but vary when compared to Southern Nambikwara. Southern Nambikwara has a much larger vowel inventory, including [[Vowel#Phonation|creaky]] and nasal vowels.<ref name="Antunes"/>

==Morphology==

The roots of nouns in Sabanê can only exist as parts of larger words (they are bound morphemes), and must be followed either by a referential suffix in isolation or by a referential or derivational suffix in context. There is no system for identifying a noun’s gender morphologically, so gender must be inferred or indicated lexically. This is also the case for age and numbers. Possessive pronouns are not required. Compounding is used frequently, with the combined meanings of the individual words often being very different from the meaning of the final compound. There are seven different classifiers for nouns.<ref name="Antunes"/> 
The verbal theme is composed of a verbal root and verbal suffix, however these verbal suffixes can be attached to adjectives and numerals to make them verbal adjectives and verbal numerals. That being said, adjectives are actually considered verbs due to structural similarity. Morphemes are used to indicate an imminent action, while suffixes are used to indicate supposition, hearsay desire, and negation. Sentences can be either assertive, interrogative, or imperative. While the assertive and interrogative moods are marked by suffixes, the imperative mood is unmarked.<ref name="Antunes"/>

=== Pronouns ===
Subject personal [[pronouns]] are mandatory in the absence of a nominal subject.
There are two classes of personal pronouns: subject pronouns, which are free morphemes except for pi– and object pronouns, which are bound morphemes.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{| class='wikitable' style= 'text-align: center;"

|
|

|-
|}

In Sabanê the [[pronoun]]s uli and towali are [[Bound and unbound morphemes|free morphemes]] which means that they do not appear affixed to the verb.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|towali ilaw -n -al -i
|1SG.SUBJ {to be big} -VS -PRES.NEUT ASSR
|"I am fat."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|uli wola kiki -n -datinan
|2SG.SUBJ {a lot} {to scratch} -VS -PRES.EV
|"You scratch it a lot."}}

The pronouns p-, m-, t-, a- and pi-, ma-,ta- , are all [[Bound and unbound morphemes|bound morphemes]], therefore they appear [[prefix]]ed on the verb.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|uli pi- kal -i -dana
|2SG.SUBJ 1PL.OBJ- {to cut} -VS -PRES.EV
|"You cut us."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|wayulu t- ip -i -datinan
|dog 1SG.OBJ- {to see} -VS -PRES.EV
|"The dog saw me."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|towali -mi m- yotop -a -dana
|1SG.SUBJ -REF 2PL.OBJ- {to know} -VS -PRES.EV
|"I know you."}}

Note that in Sabanê, the third person singular and  plural subject are not phonologically expressed. The third person singular and plural object are only phonologically expressed when the verb begins with a consonant.<ref name="Antunes"/> (As seen below)

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ileypelu a- kalit -i -al -i
|today/now 3SG.OBJ- {to cook} -VS -PRES.NEUT -Assr
|"She cooks it now."}}

===Negation of Verbs in Sabanê===

In the Sabanê language, [[Affirmative and negative|negation]] of a verb is not marked by a single word on its own like languages such as [[English language|English]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Instead, negation is marked by the particle -mi(si)na which is [[suffix]]ed to the verbal theme. Because this particle is affixed to the verb it cannot stand by itself. Generally, the shorter form -mina is used more often that the longer form -misina.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|kanaysik ii -n -mina -al -i
|pepper {to be hot} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -NEG -PRES.NEUT -Assr
|"The pepper is not hot."}}

However, in cases where the progressive suffix -say is used, -mi(si)na can optionally occur after this progressive suffix instead of after the verbal suffix. Native speakers do this switching, but the meaning of the sentence does not change.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=2
|Ani -n -say -mina -al -i
|{to feel} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -PROG -NEG -PRES.NEUT -Assr
|}}

{{interlinear|indent=2
|Ani -n -mina -say -al -i
|{to feel} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -NEG -PROG -PRES.NEUT -Assr
|"S/he is not pretending ."}}

Negation in the [[imperative mood]] is similarly obtained, by which the negative particle is suffixed to the verbal theme.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|t- osa -n -mina
|1SG.OBJ- {to give} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -NEG
|"Do not give it to me!"}}

Lastly, because -mi(si)na is a bound morpheme it can not grammatically form a sentence. This means that when responding to a question negatively, a full sentence must be constructed.<ref name="Antunes"/>

:'''Question:'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|isun -i -al -a
|{to be angry} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -PRES.NEUT -INT
|"Is s/he angry"}}

:'''Grammatical answer:'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|isun -i -mina -al -i
|{to be angry} -{{gcl|VS|verbal suffix}} -NEG -PRES.NEUT ASSR
|"She is not angry"}}

:'''Ungrammatical answer:'''
:'''* Mina'''
:"No"

===Oppositional morphological marking of assertive and interrogative sentences===

Most languages in the world do not morphologically express an opposition between assertive and interrogative sentences. That being said, Sabanê uses an assertive suffix (-i), and an interrogative suffix (-a), attached to neutral tense forms of verbs.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|iney -i -ntal -i
|{to fall} -VS -PRET.NEUT -ASSR
|"S/he fell."}}

While the few languages that do express a morphological opposition for assertive and interrogative sentences, they typically leave the assertive unmarked, while Sabanê marks both the assertive and the interrogative. The suffixes used to mark these ‘moods’ occupy the same syntactic slot, so the use of one suffix excludes the use of the other. In Sabanê the interrogative suffix must occur with a question word, such as ‘who’ or ‘what’.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|iney -i -ntal -a
|{to fall} -VS -PRET.NEUT -INT
|"Did s/he fall?"}}

==Syntax==

=== Case and Agreement === 
 
In order to discuss Sabanê’s case system, it is first important to define certain terms used to represent arguments of differing roles, and how they are used to classify case systems. These three terms are S, A, and P. S is used to describe the only nominal argument of a single-argument clause.<ref name="Payne">{{cite book |last=Payne|first= Thomas|date=1997|title=Describing Morphosyntax: A Guide for Field Linguistics.|location=England |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521588057}}</ref> A and P are used within multi-argument clauses however, with A describing the most-agent like argument and P describing the most patient-like argument. In Sabanê, patient S arguments of some [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] verbs are marked the same as P arguments of [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] sentences, being marked by a -k.<ref name="Antunes"/> Conversely, A arguments as well as S arguments of transitive sentences are not marked.<ref name="Antunes"/> Given these conditions of Sabanê’s system, it is categorized as [[Active-stative language|Split Intransitive]].<ref name="Antunes"/> A Split Intransitive case system is described as a system in which some S arguments are marked like transitive P arguments, while others are marked like transitive A arguments. The evolutionary process of this kind of system is typically made up of several successive developments over time, however given the lack of data for Sabanê the development of its particular split intransitivity is not known.<ref name="Antunes"/> The following examples are examples of the presence and absence of markings for S, A, and P arguments in Sabanê.

:'''Patient S argument of intransitive verb (marked with -k)'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Towali kiata -k ilul -i -datinan 
|1SUBJ corn -OBJ {to eat} -VS -PRET.EV
|"I ate corn"}}

:'''S argument of transitive verb unmarked'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Towali ilul -i -dana
|1SUBJ {to eat} -VS -PRES.EV
|"I eat."}}

:'''A argument of transitive sentence'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Manoel t- osa -n -ntal -i anose -mi
|Manoel 1OBJ {to give} -VS -PRET.NEUT -ASSR bowl -REF
|"Manoel gave me a bowl."}}

[[Agent (grammar)|Agentive pronouns]] are used in Sabanê to mark volitional verbs (controlled actions), while [[Patient (grammar)|patientive pronouns]] are used to mark non-volitional verbs (uncontrolled actions). Below is a table of the agentive and patientive pronouns in Sabanê.<ref name="Antunes"/>

{| class='wikitable' style= 'text-align: center;"
|-
! Person
! Agentive

| p-
| pi-
|-
! 2nd person
| uli
| m-
| ma-
|-
! 3rd person
|
|
| a-
|-
|}

While Sabane exhibits a split intransitive case system, this system has some specific rules. Objects expressed by nouns in transitive sentences must be marked by -k, and if it expressed by a pronoun the pronoun must be patientive.<ref name="Antunes"/> Subjects in transitive sentences are unmarked if they are a proper noun and the object is marked by -k. 
Agreement markers in Sabanê do not exist, shown particularly through the lack of grammatical gender, and lack of morphological opposition between animate and inanimate objects.<ref name="Antunes"/>

== Semantics==
===Tense Structure===
In Sabane, all sentences must include a tense morpheme, with the exception of sentences in the imperative mood.<ref name="Antunes"/> Unlike many other Brazilian languages, Sabane consists of three tenses: the past, the present and the future.  These tense morphemes are bound morphemes (suffixes) that appear after the verbal theme or other verbal suffixes in a sentence. Additionally, in Sabane evidentiality and tense are combined into a single morpheme. This means that this language distinguishes between evidential events (sensory or inferential) and non-evidential/ neutral events (neutral or inferred neutral), which is all marked with tense.<ref name="Antunes"/>
*'''Note''': the assertive morpheme -i or the interrogative morpheme -a can only be used to mark neutral tense.

|-
|}

====The Past====
The [[Past tense|past]] consists of four forms, which are morphologically marked and based on evidentiality and non evidentiality.

'''-ntal assumes neutrality in the sentence.'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Manoel a- kan -n -ntal -i*
|Manoel 3OBJ- {to kill} -VS -PRET.NEUT -ASSR
|"Manoel killed him"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Hay ay -i -ntal -a*
|already {to go} -VS -PRET.NEUT -INT
|"Did s/he already go?"}}

'''-np is used when the speaker believes that an event could have happened based on inference.'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|m- yotop -i -np -i*
|2OBJ- {to know} -VS -PRET.NEUT.INF -ASSR
|"(one infers that) you knew it"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|m- yotop -i -np -a*
|2OBJ- {to know} -VS -PRET.NEUT.INF -INT
|"Did you know it (it seems you did)"}}

'''-datinan is used when the hearer concludes that the sentence is factual based on the speaker's availability of sensory evidence.'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|wayulu -mi ip -i -datinan
|dog -REF {to run} -VS -PRET.EV
|"The dog ran"}}

'''-tika is used when the speaker uses hearsay evidence for the factuality of an event.'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|may -i -mina -tika -towali ay -i telon
|{to walk} -VS -NEG -PASS.INF 1SUBJ {to go} -VS FUT.EV
|"He did not arrive (because of the fact that) I am leaving"}}
'''*note''':-tika is only found in sentences preceding evidential sentences

The distinction between recent past (today) and less recent pass (yesterday and beyond) is expressed by using the adverbs '''ileypelu''' ‘today’ and '''ileytika''' ‘yesterday’.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ileypelu -a kalit -i -datinan
|today -3OBJ {to cook} -VS -PRET.EV
|"S/he cooked it today"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ileytika -a kalit -i -datinan
|today -3OBJ {to cook} -VS -PRET.EV
|"S/he cooked it yesterday"}}

==== The Present ====

There are two morphemes that are used to mark present tense in Sabane: '''-al''' is used for the present neutral and '''-dana''' is used for the present evidential.
 
'''-al assumes neutrality in the sentence'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|ilul -i -say -al -i*
|{to eat} -VS -PROG -PRES.NEUT -ASSR
|"She is eating"}}

'''-dana is used to infer factuality of the sentence and implies that there is sensory evidence'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|towali ilul -i -dana
|1SUBJ {to eat} -VS -PRES.EV
|"I eat"}}

==== The Future ====
There are two morphemes that are used to mark future tense in Sabane:  '''-tapanal''' is used for the  neutral future and '''-telon''' is used for the evidential future.

''' -tapanal can only be used in a non-factual or elicited sentence '''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|ilul -i -tapanal -i*
|{to eat} -VS -FUT.NEUT -ASSR
|"S/he will eat"}}

'''-telon can only be used in a sentence in which the speaker is confident regarding its factuality'''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|amayl -i -telon
|{to rain} -VS -FUT.EV
|"It is going to rain"}}
