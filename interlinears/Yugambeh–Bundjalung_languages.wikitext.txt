{{IPA notice}}

'''Yugambeh–Bundjalung,''' also known as '''Bandjalangic''', is a branch of the [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan language family]], that is spoken in north-eastern [[New South Wales]] and [[South-East Queensland]].

Yugambeh–Bundjalung was historically a dialect continuum consisting of a number of [[dialect|varietie]]s, including [[Yugambeh dialect|Yugambeh]], Nganduwal, Minjangbal, Njangbal (Nyangbal), Biriin, Baryulgil, Waalubal, Dinggabal, Wiyabal, Gidabal, Galibal, and Wudjeebal. Language varieties in the group vary in degree of mutual intelligibility, with varieties at different ends of the continuum being mostly unintelligible.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/middleclarencedi0000crow/page/252|title=The middle Clarence dialects of Bandjalang|last=Terry.|first=Crowley|date=1978|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies|others=Smythe, W.

* [[Yugambeh Language|Tweed-Albert Language (Yugambeh)]] 
* [[Githabul language|Condamine-Upper Clarence (Githabul)]]
* Lower Richmond (Eastern Bundjalung – Nyangbal, Minyangbal and Bandjalang proper)
* [[Wahlubal|Middle Clarence (Western Bundjalung)]]
Bowern (2011) lists Yugambeh, Githabul, Minyangbal, and Bandjalang as separate ''Bandjalangic'' languages.<ref>Bowern, Claire. 2011.

== Nomenclature ==
The Yugambeh-Bundjalung language chain is spoken by numerous social/cultural groups some of whom have historically preferred to identify with their particular dialect name, e.g. Githabul, Yugambeh, especially as some groups do not see particular varieties as being '''the same language'.''

W.E.Smythe, a doctor in Casino, knew the Bundjalung quite well noting in his time the language was spoken widely. He compiled a grammar of the Casino dialect in the 1940s, mistakenly believing he was writing a grammar for the whole language group.  When speaking of the name of language he noted:

'For the linguistic group as a whole I have used the term 'Bandjalang', with which some may disagree. Among the people themselves there is a good deal of confusion. Some say the tribal name should be 'Beigal[Baygal]' (man, people), others that there never was any collective name, while others again state that 'Bandjalang', besides being the specific name of one of the local groups, was also in use as a covering term for alI. For convenience I am doing the same.'<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Dialect groups as described by githabal prople.png|thumb|515x515px|Map of dialects as described by the Githabul at Woodenbong (Geyteenbeek)]]
Adding to the confusion is the use of multiple names by different groups, i.e. what one group calls another may not be what it calls itself, or the name of a dialect may change, e.g. Terry crowley was originally told ''Wehlubal'' for the Baryulgil dialect, while a later researcher was given ''Wirribi.''

The earliest sources of anthropological work dated from the mid to late 1800s does not give a name for the entire language chain, however it is clear from sources that particular writers were aware of it, in most instances referring to it by their local variety name or with a descriptor like '''this language with slight variation..'.'' It was not until the early 1900s, with the advent of Aboriginal Protection Boards that non-Indigenous sources begin overtly naming wider language groups, this however was at a detriment to local dialect and clan names that were subsumed under the board's chosen name; Yugambeh-Bundjalung's position on the QLD-NSW border lead to two standard terms Yugambeh/Yugumbir on the Queensland side and Bundjalung/Bandjalang on the New South Wales side. It was for this reason that Margaret Sharpe named the chain Yugambeh-Bundjalung, the terms being the most northerly and southerly respectively as well.<ref name="C. 2005">{{Cite book|title=Grammar and texts of the Yugambeh-Bundjalung dialect chain in Eastern Australia|last=C.|first=Sharpe, Margaret|date=2005|publisher=Lincom Europa|isbn=3895867845|location=Muenchen|chapter=Yugambeh-Bundjalung Dialects|oclc=62185149}}</ref>

Modern Yugambeh-Bundjalung speaking peoples are often aware of and use the overarching terms 'Yugambeh' and 'Bundjalung', some groups in conjunction with their own name e.g. Byron Bay Bundjalung – Arakwal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arakwal.com.au/about-us/|title=Arakwal People of Byron Bay » Blog Archive » About Us|website=arakwal.com.au|access-date=2018-01-08}}</ref> As these words also refer to individual dialects some groups object to their usage, Crowley and Sharpe both agree that Yugambeh referred to the Beaudesert dialect, also known by the clan name Mununjali, and Bundjalung originally referred to the Bungawalbin Creek / Coraki dialect, though the Tabulam people claim they are the original Bundjalung, and use Bandjalang in opposition.<ref name="C. 2005"/><ref name="Terry. 1978">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/middleclarencedi0000crow|title=The middle Clarence dialects of Bandjalang|last=Terry.|first=Crowley|date=1978|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies|others=Smythe, W. E.|isbn=0855750650|location=Canberra|oclc=6041138|url-access=registration}}</ref>

== Geographic distribution ==
Yugambeh-Bandjalang is spoken over a wide geographic area; the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east and  the [[Logan River]] catchment as the northern boundary, the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] forming the south and south-western boundaries, and the [[Northern Tablelands]] marking the western boundary.<ref name=":0" />

Many of the dialects and branches are confined by natural features such as river basins, mountain ranges and dense bushland.

== Dialects ==
"Yugambeh-Bundjalung" or just "Bundjalung" is used as a cover term for the [[dialect chain]] as well as to refer to certain individual dialects. At the time of the first European settlement in the mid-1800s, the Yugambeh-Bundjalung peoples on the north coast of New South Wales and southeast of Queensland spoke up to twenty related dialects. Today only about nine remain. All were mutually intelligible with neighbouring dialects. The dialects form recognisable clusters that share phonological and morphological features, as well as having higher degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref name=":0" />

== Dialectal differences ==
Until the 1970s all language and linguist work to date had been undertaken on individual varieties, with major grammar work undertaken on [[Githabul language|Githabul]], Minyangbal, Yugambeh, and the Casino dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/2971|title=Gidabal grammar and dictionary|website=SIL International|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/39789468|title=A description of the Yugumbir dialect of Bandjalang|last=Cunningham|first=M.

==Phonology==
=== Vowel ===
Varieties of Yugambeh-Bundjalung may have a vowel system of either 3 or 4 vowels that also contrast in length, resulting in either 6 or 8 [[Phoneme|phonemic]] vowels in total.<ref name=Sharpe>{{cite book |last=Sharpe |first=Margaret C. |title=Grammar and Texts of the Yugambeh-Bundjalung Dialect Chain in Eastern Australia |year=2005 |publisher=LINCOM |location=Muenchen, Germany |isbn=3-89586-784-5 |pages=180}}</ref>

In practical orthography and some descriptions of the language, the letter "h" is often used after the vowel to indicate a long vowel.<ref name=Sharpe/>

'''Vowel alternations'''

{{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are [[Vowel reduction|neutralised]] as {{IPA|[ɛ]}} before {{IPA|/j/}}.

The low central vowel {{IPA|/a/}} can be [[Raising (phonetics)#Advanced and retracted|fronted]] and [[Raising (phonetics)#Raised and lowered|raised]] following a [[palatal consonant]], and [[Raising (phonetics)#Advanced and retracted|backed]] following a [[velar consonant]].<ref name=Sharpe/>

[[unstressed vowel|Unstressed]] short vowels can be [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to the neutral central vowel [[schwa]] in a similar way to English.<ref name=Sharpe/>

=== Consonants ===
Yugambeh-Bundjalung has a smaller inventory of consonant phonemes than is typical of most Australian languages, having only four contrastive [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] and only one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and one [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] phoneme.

'''Obstruents'''

Although the standard IPA symbols used in transcription of the language are the [[Plosive|voiced stop]] symbols, these segments are better characterised as [[obstruent]]s because they are realised more often as [[fricative]]s or [[affricate]]s than actual stops. There is no contrast in Yugambeh-Bundjalung between these [[Manner of Articulation|manners of articulation]].<ref name=Sharpe/>

Yugambeh-Bundjalung varieties do not have [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] contrasts for their obstruent sequences, and so phonological literature varies in its representation of these consonants- some linguists have chosen the symbols [[voiceless bilabial plosive|/p/]], [[voiceless velar plosive|/k/]], [[voiceless palatal plosive|/c/]], [[voiceless alveolar plosive|/t/]], and others have decided upon [[voiced bilabial plosive|/b/]], [[voiced velar plosive|/g/]], [[voiced palatal plosive|/{{IPA|ɟ}}/]], [[voiced velar plosive|/d/]]. Generally, these consonants are phonetically voiceless, except when following a [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] [[nasal stop|nasal]] segment.<ref name=Sharpe/>

'''Nasals'''

When nasal stops occur syllable-finally, they are often produced with a [[prestopped nasal|stop onset]] as a [[free variation|free variant]].<ref name=Sharpe/>

'''Lateral'''

The lateral phoneme can appear as a [[alveolar flap|flap]] rather than an [[approximant consonant|approximant]], and sometimes occurs prestopped as a free variant in the same way as nasals.<ref name=Sharpe/>

'''Rhotic'''

The rhotic phoneme has several [[allophone|surface realisations]] in Yugambeh-Bundjalung. Between vowels, it tends to be a [[alveolar flap|flap]], although it can sometimes be an [[alveolar approximant|approximant]], and it is usually a [[alveolar trill|trill]] at the end of syllables.<ref name=Sharpe/>

'''Semi-vowels'''

The existence of semi-vowels in Yugambeh-Bundjalung can be disputed, as in many Australian languages. Some linguists posit their existence in order to avoid an analysis that involves [[syllable onset#Onset|onset-less syllables]], which are usually held to be non-existent in Australian languages. Some phonologists have found that semi-vowels can be replaced with [[glottal stop]]s in some varieties of Yugambeh-Bundjalung.<ref name=Sharpe/>

=== Stress ===

Yugambeh-Bundjalung is a [[stress-timed language#Stress timing|stress-timed language]] and is [[quantity sensitivity|quantity-sensitive]], with stress being assigned to syllables with long vowels. Short unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to the neutral vowel schwa.<ref name=Sharpe/>

=== Syllable structure ===

Like many Australian languages, Yugambeh-Bundjalung is thought to have a constraint that states that all syllables must have a consonant onset. Only vowels are permitted as the [[syllable nucleus#Nucleus|syllable nucleus]], and these may be long or short. Syllable [[syllable coda|codas]] are also permitted, with long or short vowels in the nucleus. However, long vowels are not permitted to occur in adjacent syllables.<ref name=Sharpe/>

=== Phonotactics ===

'''Consonant clusters'''

Yugambeh-Bundjalung does not permit [[consonant cluster|clusters]] of the same consonant, or clusters that begin with an obstruent phoneme or end with an approximant, except the labio-velar glide. All homorganic nasal-obstruent clusters occur in the language. Clusters usually only involve two segments, but clusters of three may occur if an intervening vowel is deleted by some process.<ref name=Sharpe/>

=== Vocabulary ===
[[File:Yugambeh-Bundjalung Dialect Chain Situation.jpg|left|thumb|345x345px|Cognate analysis percentages provided by Crowley]]
Cognate comparison between the most southern and northern dialects, Bandjalang (Proper) and Yugambeh (Proper), shows 52% similarity. Cognate similarity is highest between dialects within branches, typically being ~80%, these percentages are even higher amongst the Tweed-Albert dialects at ~90%. Between branches of the family this rate falls to ~60-70% between neighbouring clusters.<ref name="Terry. 1978"/>

==== Isogloss ====
Some vocabulary differences in common vocabulary are present: 
[[File:Man-Woman Isogloss of Yugambeh-Bundjalung.png|thumb|Isogloss for Man (Mibiny/Baygal) and Woman (Jalgan/Dubay)]]
''What/Something - Nyang'' in southern varieties contrast with ''Minyang'' in northern varieties. (Both were used in the centrally located Lismore dialect).

The northern [[Tweed-Albert language]] have ''Mibin'' for man and ''Jalgany'' for woman, compared to the use of ''Baygal'' and ''Dubay'' by other varieties respectively. The difference in words for men is significant as groups often use it for identification as well as a language name (''Mibinah'' = language lit. ''of man'', ''Baygalnah'' = language lit. ''of man'').

Another vocabulary isogloss is ''Jabu (Boy)'' and ''Mih (Eye)'' used in all branches, except the [[Wahlubal|Middle-Clarence language]] which uses ''Janagan'' and ''Jiyaw'' respectively.<ref name="Terry. 1978"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Grammar and texts of the Yugambeh-Bundjalung dialect chain in Eastern Australia|last=C.|first=Sharpe, Margaret|date=2005|publisher=Lincom Europa|isbn=3895867845|location=Muenchen|oclc=62185149}}</ref>

==== Vowel shifts ====
A north to south shift of /a/ to /e/ (with an intermittent /i/ present in some varieties) in some common vocabulary.

: ''Who - Ngahn / Ngihn / Ngehn''
: You - Wahlu / Wihlu / Wehlu

A north to south shift of /i/ to /a/ (with an intermittent/e/ present in some varieties) occurring on the demonstrative set.

: ''This - Gali / Gale / Gala''
: ''That - Mali / Male / Mala''

A shift of /a/ to /u/ in the Tweed-Albert dialects.

: ''No - Yugam / Yagam''
: ''Vegetable - Nungany / Nangany''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=(https://www.informit.org/researchers/who-is-informit)|first=Informit - RMIT Training PTY LTD|date=1985|title=Bundjalung Settlement and Migration|url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=057737298952193;res=IELAPA|journal=Aboriginal History|language=en|volume=9}}</ref>

== Grammar ==
Crowley's research found a number of grammar differences between the varieties and clusters, further research by Dr. Margaret Sharpe detailed these finer differences.

=== Noun declensions ===
All varieties within the family use suffixes to decline nouns, most are universal, however there are a few poignant differences. A complex system exists whereby suffixes are categorised into orders, with the order and use governed by universal rules.

=== Locative ===
A past and non-past form of the locative exists in [[Githabul language|Githabul]], [[Yugambeh language|Yugambeh]] and Minyangbal.

=== Abessive ===
The abessive -Djam is present in Yugambeh and Githabul, being used on nouns and verbs (use on verbs does not occur further south).

=== Gender ===
A system of marking four [[Grammatical gender]]s (2 Animate - human & animal, and 2 Inanimate - arboreal & neuter) with the use of suffixes is present in 3 of the clusters. The morphological forms and usage of these gender suffixes vary between the clusters, with some dialects marking both demonstratives & adjectives, others marking solely adjectives.

=== Verbal morphology ===
The extensive use of suffixes extends to verbs as well, the suffix system is the same throughout the language group with a few minor differences.

The imminent aspect (used in other varieties for most instances that use the English future tense) has shifted in the [[Yugambeh language|Tweed-Albert Language]] to an irrealis mode, now denoting the potential mood, while the continuous aspect in conjunction with a time word is now used for future tense situations.

Example of differences in -hny suffix usage.

; Wiyabal
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Ngayu yagahny ngumbin
|I-ERG build-IMM house
|"I will build a house"}}

; Yugambeh (Proper)
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Ngayu yagahny ngumbin guh
|I-ERG build-POT house {over there}
|"I might build a house over there"}}

; Yugambeh (Proper)
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Ngayu yagahla ngumbin guh ngulungmay
|I-ERG build-CONT house {over there} shortly
|"I will build a house over there shortly"}}

The purposive suffix is -yah in the Tweed-Albert and Condamine-Upper Clarence languages, while it is -gu in the other two branches.

; Yugambeh (Proper)
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Nyule yangehn ngumbin yagayah guh
|he-ERG went-PST house build-PURP {over there}
|"He went to build a house over there."}}

; Wahlubal
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Nyula yangahn ngumbin yagagu gah
|he-ERG went-PST house build-PURP {over there}
|"He went to build a house over there"}}
