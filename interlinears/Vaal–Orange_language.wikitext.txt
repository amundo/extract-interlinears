'''Vaal–Orange''', also known as '''Seroa''', is an extinct [[Tuu languages|ǃKwi language]] of [[South Africa]] and [[Lesotho]].  It comprised the ''ǂUngkue'' dialect (also rendered ''ǂKunkwe'') of the [[Warrenton, Northern Cape|Warrenton]] area, recorded by [[Carl Meinhof]], and the ''ǁŨǁʼe'' dialect (also rendered ''ǁKu-ǁʼe'' or ''ǁKuǁe''),<ref>Distinguish ''ǁNg ǃʼe'', a form of [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]], and ''Nǀhuǁéi'', which is a variety of [[Taa language|Taa]].</ref> spoken near [[Theunissen]] and [[Bethany, Free State|Bethany]] in South Africa and into Lesotho, recorded by [[Dorothea Bleek]].<ref>Tom Güldemann (2011) "The Lower Nossob varieties of Tuu: ǃUi, Taa or neither?"</ref>

The name "Vaal–Orange" comes from the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and [[Orange River]]s, which converge where ǂUngkue dialect was spoken.  ''Seroa'' is the [[Sesotho]] name, literally "language of the ''Baroa'' (Bushmen)".

Like [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]], ǂUngkue used 'inclusory' pronouns for compound subjects:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ǃhoeti nan koro nan tuē n a ‖ʼa
|lion and jackal and ostrich they ?PAST go
|'The lion and jackal and ostrich, they went'. (Meinhof 1929)}}
