==== Reduplication ====
Reduplication can either be inflectional or stylistic. Inflectional reduplication in Mungbam establishes [[Focus (linguistics)verum focus]].

==== Nominalization ====
There are two processes which nominalize verbs: a productive, well-attested process to form [[infinitive]]s, and a less productive, virtually un-attested process to create the “disability construction.”

The “disability” construction describes humans or animals who are ‘disabled.’

==== Concord ====
[[Concord (grammar)Concord]] refers to noun-class agreement within the noun-phrase. There are three means by which Mungbam achieves concord: prefixation, tonal stem change, segmental stem change. Tonal concord causes a shift in tone when nouns are a part of an associated noun phrase.

== Syntax ==
The basic [[word order]] of Mungbam is [[Subject–verb–objectSVO]].

The ordering of constituents within the Mungbam noun phrase is as follows: Noun, associated noun phrase, possession and other [[Grammatical modifiermodifier]], adjective, number, [[demonstrative]], [[relative clause]], [[Determiner (grammar)determiner]].

=== Negation ===
Sentences are typically [[Negation (grammar)negated]] by the addition of a particle towards the end of the sentence. While this addition may change the word order in [[Transitive verbtransitive]] sentences, [[Intransitive verbintransitive]] sentences always keep the SV word order.
