'''Yapese''' is a language spoken by the people on the [[island]] of [[Yap]] ([[Federated States of Micronesia]]). It belongs to the [[Austronesian languages]], more specifically to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of that family.  It has been difficult to classify it further, but Yapese may prove to be one of the [[Admiralty Islands languages]].{{r|Lynchetal2002}}

Written Yapese uses [[Latin script]]. In Yapese spelling as practiced until the 1970s, the glottal stop was not written with an explicit character. A word-final glottal stop was represented by doubling the final vowel letter. [[Glottalization]] of consonants was represented with an apostrophe. In the 1970s an orthography was created which uses double vowel letters to represent long vowels; and because of the ambiguity that would occur if the glottal stop was not written, the glottal stop was written with the letter ''q''. This new orthography using the letter ''q'' is not in universal use, but many works and maps about Yap write place names using the new q-orthography.

==Phonology==

Apart from a couple grammatical forms which are V, syllables are CV or CVC.

===Consonants===

Yapese is one of the relatively few languages in the world with [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[fricative]]s.<ref>{{SOWL|178}}</ref> The Yapese ejective consonants are {{IPA|/pʼ tʼ kʼ fʼ θʼ/}}. There are also glottalised nasals {{IPA|/mˀ nˀ ŋˀ/}} and approximants {{IPA|/jˀ wˀ lˀ/}}.{{r|Jensen1977|p=30, 34-35}}

In the table below, each [[phoneme]] is listed to the left of the [[grapheme]] that represents it in Yapese orthography.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Reduplication====
Yapese makes use of [[reduplication]] for several morphological functions, including deriving [[stative]] adjectives from [[Inchoative aspect|inchoative]] adjectives, as in (1a–b), as well as to make [[Diminutive|diminutives]] of verbs, as in (2a-b):{{r|Jensen1977|p=112-114}}

{|
| {{interlinear| number = (1a) | roow | become.red | 'to become red'}}
| {{interlinear| number = (1b) | roow~roow | STAT~red | 'to be red' }}
|-
| {{interlinear| number = (2a) | toey | chop | 'to chop' }}
| {{interlinear| number = (2b) | si-toey~toey | DIM-DIM~chop | 'to chop a little' }}
|}

====Pronouns====
Yapese distinguishes between three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual, and plural) and three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second, and third), as well as [[Clusivity|clusivity]] in its personal pronouns.{{r|Jensen1977|p=134}}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Independent personal pronouns
|-
!
! Singular
! Dual
! Plural
|-
