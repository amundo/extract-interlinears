The '''Yaeyama language''' ({{lang|rys|八重山物言/ヤイマムニ}}, ''Yaimamuni'') is a [[Southern Ryukyuan languages|Southern Ryukyuan language]] spoken in the [[Yaeyama Islands]], the southernmost inhabited island group in [[Japan]], with a combined population of about 53,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zephyr.justhpbs.jp/data_list.html|title = 八重山のデータ}}</ref> The [[Yaeyama Islands]] are situated in the Southern [[Ryukyu Islands]], southwest of the [[Miyako Islands]] and to the east of [[Taiwan]]. Yaeyama (''Yaimamunii'') is most closely related to [[Miyakoan language|Miyako]]. The number of competent native speakers is not known; as a consequence of Japanese language policy which refers to the language as the {{nihongo|Yaeyama dialect|八重山方言|Yaeyama hōgen}}, reflected in the education system, people below the age of 60 tend to not use the language except in songs and rituals, and the younger generation exclusively uses Japanese as their first language. As compared to the Japanese ''kokugo,'' or Japanese [[national language]], other Ryukyuan languages such as [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] and [[Amami Ōshima language|Amami]] have also been referred to as dialects of [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Barion|first2=Fija|last3=Brenzinger|first3=Matthias|title=The Ryukyus and the New, But Endangered, Languages of Japan|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=9 May 2009|volume=7|issue=19|page=2|url=http://apjjf.org/-Patrick-Heinrich/3138/article.html|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> Yaeyama is noted as having a comparatively lower "language vitality" among neighboring Ryukyuan languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Barion|first2=Fija|last3=Brenzinger|first3=Matthias|title=The Ryukyus and the New, But Endangered, Languages of Japan|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=9 May 2009|volume=7|issue=19|page=6}}</ref>

Yaeyama is spoken in [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigaki]], [[Taketomi Island|Taketomi]], [[Kohama Island|Kohama]], [[Kuroshima (Okinawa)|Kuroshima]], [[Hatoma]], Aragusuku, [[Iriomote-jima|Iriomote]] and [[Hateruma]], with complications of [[mutual intelligibility]] between dialects as a result of the Yaeyama Islands' large geographic span. The speech of [[Yonaguni Island]], while related, is usually considered a [[Yonaguni language|separate language]]. The Taketomi dialect may instead be a [[Northern Ryukyuan languages|Northern Ryukyuan]] language common to [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] dialects that later converged with the other Yaeyama dialects.<ref>{{cite thesis |surname=Thorpe |given=Maner Lawton |title=Ryūkyūan language history |publisher=University of Southern California |year=1983 |type=PhD thesis |url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll3/id/505374 }}</ref>

== History ==
The Ryukyuan language split from Proto-Japonic when its speakers migrated to the Ryukyu Islands.[[Kuroshima (Okinawa)|<ref>Kerr, George.

The Yaeyaman languages are classified under a [[Macro-Yaeyama languages|Macro-Yaeyama]] branch of the Southern Ryukyuan languages. Innovations of Southern Ryukyuan languages, splitting Macro-Yaeyama and Miyako language families, include an "irregular shift from tone class B to A in 'how many' and a special form for 'garden'".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=18}}</ref> Macro-Yaeyama innovations, grouping together Yaeyama languages and [[Yonaguni language|Dunan]] contain the "grammaticalization of 'know' as a potential auxiliary", similarities between multiple special forms such as "bud", "happy", "fresh", and "dirt", as well as a semantic conflation of "nephew" to mean either "nephew" or "niece".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=19}}</ref> Yaeyaman dialects are differentiated from Dunan by innovations regarding a replacement of the verb "sell" with a causative form of "buy", a special form of "get wet", as well as an irregular shift of "*g>n" in 'beard'.<ref name=":22"/>

Some of the pronunciations that disappeared from Japanese around the 8th century, Japan's Nara period, can still be found in the Yaeyama languages. One example is the initial "p" sound, which in Japanese became an "h", while remaining a "p" in Yaeyama, except for "pu", which became "fu" in Yaeyama.

|}

While the Yaeyama language was more "conservative" in some aspects, in the sense of preserving certain pronunciations, in other aspects it was more innovative. One example is the vowel system. [[Old Japanese]] had eight vowels (some perhaps diphthongs); this has been reduced to five in modern Japanese, but in Yaeyaman, vowel reduction has progressed further, to three vowels. Generally, when modern Japanese has an "e", the Yaeyama cognate will have an "i" (this is seen in "funi" above); and where modern Japanese has an "o", the Yaeyama cognate will have a "u" (as seen in "patu" above).

{|border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing=0 style="margin: auto; border: 1px solid #88a; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;

However, in the cases where Proto-Japonic has an ''*e'', ''*əy'', or ''*o'' that is not word final, Japanese is no more conservative than Yaeyama in this regard, as both underwent the same vowel raising at different stages, as shown below:
{|border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing=0 style="margin: auto; border: 1px solid #88a; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;

Like all Southern Ryukyuan languages, Yaeyama shows a "b" word initially compared to Japanese "w". This is perhaps believed to be an innovation from earlier "w". This also includes Japanese cognates that once had an initial "w" but was dropped later in the history of the language, such as "wodori" > "odori".

Many of these features have been lost in the history of the [[Okinawan language]] or were innovated compared to all other Japonic languages. One explanation for this is that it is possible to travel by sea from mainland Japan to the main island of Okinawa while keeping one island or another in sight at nearly all times; but there is a larger gap between the main island of Okinawa and the Yaeyamas, which would have required several nights on the open sea. For this reason, there was less traffic between mainland Japan and the Yaeyama islands, allowing further linguistic divergence.

== Phonology ==
=== Hateruma ===
The Hateruma dialect contains seven vowels, with no distinction between long-short vowel length, and sixteen consonants. Hateruma is noted for having more vowels than any other dialect. A [[pharyngealization|pharyngeal]] ''e'' is believed to be a result of "the coalescence of Proto-Yaeyama [[diphthong]]s '*ai and *aɨ.'"<ref name=Pappalardo2016>{{cite journal |doi=10.14277/2385-3042/AnnOr-52-16-12 |first1=Giuseppe |last1=Pappalardo |title=Conservative and Innovative Features in the Phonology of Hateruma Dialect |journal=Annali di Ca' Foscari. Serie Orientale |volume=52 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=335–49 }}</ref>

There are three accent pitches present in Hateruma: falling, level, and rising accents. To correlate pitches, there are three classes of words under an "A, B, C" system; class A words correlate with the falling pitch, and class B and C are shown to have "an uneven correspondence with the Level and Rising patterns."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=426}}</ref>

The Hateruma dialect is regarded as an innovative variety of Yaeyama Ryukyuan. It is the only dialect of the Yaeyama group to feature the pharyngeal eˤ, sonorant devoicing, noun-final consonant epenthesis and spirantization of voiceless velar stop before the vowel *i. It is also considered to have the strongest aspiration among of the Yaeyama dialects, and is also the only variety to display nasal and liquid devoicing.<ref name=Pappalardo2016/>

The pharyngeal eˤ may be regionally expressed as /ɛ/, especially among those over the age of 90.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan languages : history, structure, and use|others=Heinrich, Patrick,, Miyara, Shinshō, 1946-, Shimoji, Michinori|isbn=978-1614511151|location=Berlin|oclc=907337360|last1 = Heinrich|first1 = Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|date=2015-02-17}}</ref>

=== Hatoma ===
The Hatoma dialect contains two "tonal categories", denoted as marked and unmarked. Words of the marked class are analyzed as being "high from the syllable containing the second [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]" and unmarked words begin from a low pitch but end with a low pitch.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Languages of Japan and Korea|last=Tranter|first=Nicholas|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|location=New York|pages=384}}</ref> "Peripheral tone classes" are also noted in certain nouns and adverb.<ref name=":0" />

Hatoma is noted for having the simplest verb conjugation and [[morphophonology]] of the Yaeyama dialects. One phonological process is a sequence of ''i'', followed by ''e'', becoming ''e'' in the case of ''i'' being in a light syllable and ''ja(a)'' in a heavy syllable.<ref name=":0" /> There is also a process of a sequence ''u'', followed by ''a'' sequence becoming a long ''o'' with ''u'' in a light syllable and ''uwa(a)'' in a heavy syllable.<ref name=":0" />

=== Miyara ===
The Miyara subdialect of Ishigaki has 21 consonants and 6 vowels in its inventory. It is noted that ''e'' and ''o'' are always long, as in many varieties of [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Tyler|last2=Davis|first2=Christopher|date=10 July 2013|title=Tense, Aspect, and Mood in Miyara Yaeyaman|url=https://www.academia.edu/8126468|pages=3}}</ref> Long vowels are often shortened before the [[Japanese phonology#Moraic nasal|moraic nasal]].<ref name=":2" />

== Syntax ==
=== Hateruma ===
Hateruma uses morphology and suffixation in its verbs and adjectives. Derivational [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] expresses causative and passive forms in verbs; potential forms are equal to the  [[passive voice|passive]] form.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=431}}</ref> Verbal [[inflection]] expresses two types of [[Realis mood|indicatives]], an [[imperative mood|imperative]] form, as well as a cohortative and [[prohibitive]] ending.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=430}}</ref> Adjectives, nouns and verbs also compound and reduplicate, especially in producing adverbs from adjectives.

Hateruma has a case system with nine [[grammatical case|case]] markings and [[grammatical particle|particles]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=433}}</ref> There are eleven auxiliary verbs to denote forms of [[grammatical mood|mood]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=436}}</ref>

=== Ishigaki ===
The Ishigaki dialect is noted for having a peculiar expression of [[cardinal direction]]s. It is found that when speaking to other native speakers, Ishigaki-speakers use an "intrinsic" and "relative" frame of reference system in which "north" and "south" are expressed in an intrinsic frame of reference as the verbs ''agaru'' ("go up, climb") and ''oriru ("''go down, descend"), instead of Standard Japanese ''kita ("''north") and ''minami'' ("south").<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Takekuro|first=Makiko|date=2007|title=Language and Gesture on Ishigaki Island|url=http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/viewFile/3544/3244|journal= Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society|volume=33|pages=417–419|doi=10.3765/bls.v33i1.3544|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is found that most speakers express "east" and "west" as Standard Japanese ''hidari ("''left") and ''migi ("''right") in a relative frame of reference.<ref name=":1" />

=== Miyara ===
Miyaran Yaeyama has been argued to have no marked [[Attributive verb|attributive]] form, unlike [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] and [[Old Japanese]]. However, there is evidence that phonological conditioning, namely an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]]  ''-r'' marking between present stative ''-i'' and present tense marker ''-u'' (in order to avoid subsequent vowel sequences)'','' accounts for non-overt attributive markings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Tyler|last2=Davis|first2=Christopher|date=2013|title=Phonological Reduction and the (Re)emergence of Attributive Forms in Yaeyama Ryukyuan|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/539160bde4b0039039dfd0c7/t/57d85f24ebbd1acb40b89303/1473797926085/LauDavisJK2013.pdf|pages=1–15}}</ref>

=== Wh-Questions ===
In Yaeyama, wh-phrases are marked with ''du'', in contrast to Standard Japanese ''ka''.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=1}}

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|-
! Subject wh-question and answer
! Object wh-question and answer:

| {{interlinear|taa'''-du''' suba-ba fai|who-Q soba-PRT ate|Who ate soba?}}
| {{interlinear|kurisu-ja noo-ba'''-du''' fai|Chris-TOP what-PRT-Q ate|What did Chris eat?}}
|}

Omitting ''du'' from a wh-phrase is considered incorrect grammar. Yet, ''du'' marking is optional for adverbial or adjunct wh-phrases. In questions with multiple wh-words, only one can be marked with ''du''.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=2}} Further research is needed to learn more about Wh-questions in Yaeyama.

== Endangerment and revitalization ==
The endangerment of Ryukyuan languages is attributed to historical and governmental factors. Originating in the 1872 annexation of the Okinawan Islands to Japan and the creation of [[Okinawa Prefecture]] in 1879, there has since been a movement referred to as the "Japanization of the Luchuan Islands".<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Bairon|first2=Fija|last3=Brenzinger|first3=Matthias|date=2009|title=The Ryukyus and the New, But Endangered, Languages of Japan|url=http://apjjf.org/-Patrick-Heinrich/3138/article.html|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|volume=7}}</ref> A national language movement known as [[Japanese language|''kokugo'']] has developed in result of this. The ''kokugo'' movement includes the 1907 implementation of the Ordinance of Dialect Regulation, demoting diverse Ryukyuan languages to the status of "dialects" ([[Japanese dialects|''hogen'']]) and discouraging of speaking these dialects in the Japanese school system.<ref name=":3" />

There is estimated to be a remaining 7,000-10,000 Yaeyama speakers, mostly being spoken in the home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages: History, Structure, and Use|last1=Heinrich|first1=Patrick|last2=Miyara|first2=Shinsho|last3=Shimoji|first3=Michinori|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2015|location=Germany|pages=423–424}}</ref> There have been many revival societies and movements erected to preserve Ryukyuan languages and culture. The earliest language revival movement is regarded as being part of the Koza Society of Culture, instituted in 1955.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=Patrick|date=2005|title=Language Loss and Revitalization in the Ryukyu Islands|url=http://apjjf.org/-Patrick-Heinrich/1596/article.html|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|volume=3}}</ref> A large benefactor to preserving and reviving Ryukyuan languages is the Society for Spreading Okinawan (''Uchinaguchi fukyu kyogikai)'', whose constitution is dedicated to initiating dialect classes and Okinawan teacher training programs, as well as advancing towards a singular Okinawan [[orthography]].<ref name=":4" /> There are also notable submovements in Ryukyuan language survival present in Okinawan radio broadcasts, as well as "presentation circles and plays" and language classes integrated in the Okinawan school curriculum on the local level.<ref name=":4" />
