'''Sango''' (also spelled '''Sangho''') is the primary language spoken in the [[Central African Republic]] and also the [[official language]] of the country.<ref>{{cite book |first=William J. |last=Samarin |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSByTfudlIcC&pg=PA301 |pages= 301–34|chapter=The Status of Sango in Fact and Fiction: On the One-Hundredth Anniversary of its Conception | title=Language Change and Language Contact in Pidgins and Creoles|series=Creole language library |volume=21 |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=McWhorter |author-link=John McWhorter |publisher=John Benjamins |year=2000

Sango is a [[Creole language|creole]] based on the [[Northern Ngbandi language]]. It was used as a [[trade language]] along the [[Ubangi River]] prior to [[Ubangi-Shari|French colonisation]] in the 1880s. In colloquial speech 90% of the language's vocabulary is Sango,{{clarify|date=September 2020}} whereas in more technical speech French loanwords constitute the majority.

== Classification ==
Some linguists, following William J. Samarin, classify it as a [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi]]-based creole; however, others (like Marcel Diki-Kidiri, Charles H. Morrill) reject that classification and say that changes in Sango structures (both internally and externally) can be explained quite well without a creolization process.

According to the creolization hypothesis, Sango is exceptional in that it is an African- rather than European-based creole.<ref name="walker" /> Although [[French language|French]] has contributed numerous loanwords, Sango's structure is wholly African.<ref name="walker" />

== History ==
[[File:Sango tribe.png|thumb|Sango tribe members, 1906]]
A variety of Sango was used as a [[lingua franca]] along the [[Ubangi River]] before French colonization, in the late 1800s.<ref name="karan12.1">{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.1 Sango: language of wider communication and of the churches}}</ref> The French army recruited Central Africans, causing them to increasingly use Sango as a means of interethnic communication.<ref name="karan12.1" /> Throughout the 20th century, missionaries promoted Sango because of its wide usage.<ref name="karan12.1" />

Originally used by river traders, Sango arose as a lingua franca based on the [[Northern Ngbandi language|Northern Ngbandi]] dialect of the Sango tribe, part of the [[Ngbandi languages|Ngbandi language cluster]], with some [[French language|French]] influence.

The rapid growth of the city of [[Bangui]] since the 1960s has had significant implications for the development of Sango, with the creation, for the first time, of a population of first-language speakers. Whereas rural immigrants to the city spoke many different languages and used Sango only as a lingua franca, their children use Sango as their main (and sometimes only) language. That has led to a rapid expansion of the lexicon, including both formal and slang terms. Also, its new position as the everyday language of the capital city has led to Sango gaining greater status and being used increasingly in fields for which it was previously the norm to use French.

== Geographic distribution ==
Sango is widespread in the Central African Republic, with 350,000 speakers at the 1970 census. It is also spoken as a lingua franca in southern Chad, where it is probably not spoken natively and its use is decreasing, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where its use is increasing.

Today, Sango is both a national and official language of the Central African Republic, which makes the Central African Republic one of the few African countries to have an indigenous language as an official language.

== Registers ==
A study by Taber (1964) indicates that some 490 native Sango words account for about 90% of colloquial speech; however, while French loanwords are much more rarely used, they account for the majority of the vocabulary, particularly in the speech of learned people. The situation might be compared to English, in which most of the vocabulary, particularly "learned" words, is derived from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or French while the basic vocabulary remains strongly [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. However, more recent studies suggest that the result is specific to a particular sociolect, the so-called "functionary" variety. Morrill's work, completed in 1997, revealed that there were three sociologically distinct norms emerging in the Sango language: an urban "radio" variety which is ranked{{Clarify|reason=What does "rank" refer to?|date=October 2019}} by 80% of his interviewees and has very few French loan words; a so-called "pastor" variety, which is scored{{Clarify|reason=What were they being graded on?|date=June 2021}} 60%; and a "functionary" variety, spoken by learned people, who make the highest use of French loanwords while speaking Sango, which scores 40%.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Sango has seven oral and five nasal vowels.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Vowel quality and number of nasalized vowels may be affected by the mother tongue of non-native speakers of Sango.<ref name="karan_phonology" />

Palatal affricates occur in loan words and certain dialects.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Some dialects have alternations between [ᶬv] and [m], [ᵐb] and [ᵑ͡ᵐg͡b], [ᵐb] and [b], word-medial [l] and [r], and word-initial [h] and [ʔ].<ref name="karan_phonology" /> [ᶬv] is quite rare.<ref name="karan_phonology" />

=== Syllable structure ===
Syllable structure is generally CV.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Consecutive vowels are rare but do occur.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Consonants may be palatalized or labialized, orthographically C{{angle bracket|i}} and C{{angle bracket|u}}, respectively.<ref name="karan_phonology" />

Words are generally monosyllabic or bisyllabic but less commonly are trisyllabic.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Four-syllable words are created via [[reduplication]] and compounding, and may also be written as two words (''kêtêkêtê'' or ''kêtê kêtê'' 'tiny bit', ''walikundû'' or ''wa likundû'' 'sorcerer').<ref name="karan_phonology" />

=== Tone ===
Sango is a tonal language. The language has three basic tones (high, mid, and low), with contour tones also occurring, generally in French loanwords.<ref name="karan_phonology" /> Tones have a low [[functional load]], but [[minimal pair]]s exist: ''dü'' 'give birth' versus ''dû'' 'hole'.

Monosyllabic loan words from French usually have the tone pattern high-low falling (''bâan'' 'bench' from French ''banc''). In multisyllabic words all syllables carry low tone except the final syllable, which is lengthened and takes a descending tone. The final tone is generally mid-low falling for nouns (''ananäa'' 'pineapple' from French ''ananas'') and high-low falling for verbs (''aretêe'' 'to stop' from French ''arrêter'').

In isolation, tones have [[ideolect]]al variation, and they may also be affected by the mother language of non-native speakers.<ref name="karan_phonology" />

== Grammar ==
Sango is an [[isolating language]] with [[subject–verb–object]] word order, as in English.<ref name="karan12.4">{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.4 Sango grammatical structure}}</ref> Noun phrases are of the form determiner-adjective-noun:<ref name="karan12.4" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|mbênï kêtê môlengê
|INDEF small child
|"a small child"}}

Plurals are marked with the [[proclitic]] ''â-'', which precedes noun phrases:<ref name="karan12.4" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|â-mbênï kêtê môlengê
|PL-INDEF small child
|"some small children"}}

''â-'' may be attached to multiple items in the noun phrase by some speakers, but this is less common:<ref name="karan12.4" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|â-kötä (â)zo
|PL-big person
|"important people/dignitaries"}}

The derivational suffix ''-ngö'' [[nominalize]]s verbs. It also changes all tones in the verb to mid:<ref name="karan12.4" />

{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''kono''|| to grow, be big || ''kîri'' || to return, repeat
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''könöngö''|| size || ''kïrïngö'' || return
|}

Genitives are normally formed with the preposition ''tî'' 'of':<ref name="karan12.4" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|dû tî ngû
|hole of water
|"water hole, well"}}

However, compounding is becoming increasingly common: ''dûngü'' 'well' (note the change in tone).<ref name="karan12.4" /> Such compounds are sometimes written as two separate words.<ref name="karan12.4" />

The verbal prefix ''a-'' is used when the subject is a noun or noun phrase but not when the subject is either a pronoun or implicit (as in imperatives):<ref name="karan12.4" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|â-môlengê tî lo a-gä
|PL-child of 3S SM-come
|"his children came"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|a-dü lo
|SM-give.birth 3S
|"he was born" (lit. "someone bore him")}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|löndö mo gä
|rise 2S come
|"get up and come (here)"}}

The prefix is sometimes written as a separate word.<ref name="karan12.4" />

The [[pronoun]]s are ''mbï'' "I", ''mo'' "you (singular)", ''lo'' "he, she, it", ''ë'' "we", ''ï'' "you (plural)", ''âla'' "you (plural)", ''âla'' "they".<ref>[[Wikibooks:Sango/Pronouns]]</ref>  Verbs take a prefix ''a-'' if not preceded by a pronoun: ''mo yeke'' "you are" but ''Bêafrîka ayeke'' "Central Africa is". Particularly useful verbs include ''yeke'' "be", ''bara'' "greet" (''bara o'' "hi!"), ''hînga'' "know". Possessives and appositives are formed with the word ''tî'' "of": ''ködörö tî mbï'' "my country", ''yângâ tî sängö'' "Sango language". Another common preposition is ''na'', covering a variety of [[locative]], [[dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]] functions.

== Orthography ==
Sango began being written by French missionaries, with Catholic and Protestant conventions differing slightly.<ref name="karan_orthog_pre">{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.9 The Sango orthography before 1984}}</ref> The 1966 Bible and 1968 hymnal were highly influential and still used today.<ref name="karan_orthog_pre" />

In 1984, President [[André Kolingba]] signed "Décret No 84.025", establishing an official [[orthography]] for Sango.<ref name="karan_orthog_post">{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.9 The 1984 orthography decree}}</ref> The official Sango alphabet consists of 22 letters:

|}

Letters are pronounced as their IPA equivalent except for {{angle bracket|y}}, pronounced as [j]. Also, the digraphs {{angle bracket|kp, gb, mb, mv, nd, ng, ngb, nz}} are pronounced {{IPA|[k͡p]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ͡b]}}, {{IPA|[ᵐb]}}, {{IPA|[(ᶬv)]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿd]}}, {{IPA|[ᵑɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ᵑ͡ᵐɡ͡b]}} and {{IPA|[ⁿz]}}, respectively.

{{angle bracket|’b}}, {{angle bracket|ty}}, and {{angle bracket|dy}} may be used in loan words not fully integrated into Sango's phonological system.<ref name="karan_orthog_post" />

The official orthography contains the following [[consonant]]s: {{angle bracket|p, b, t, d, k, g, kp, gb, mb, mv, nd, ng, ngb, nz, f, v, s, z, h, l, r, y, w}}: some add {{angle bracket|’b}} for the [[implosive]] {{IPA|/ɓ/}}. Sango has seven oral [[vowel]]s, {{IPA|/a e ɛ i o ɔ u/}}, of which five, {{IPA|/ĩ ã ɛ̃ ɔ̃ ũ/}}, occur [[nasal vowel|nasalized]]. In the official orthography, {{angle bracket|e}} stands for both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{angle bracket|o}} stands for both {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}; nasal vowels are written {{angle bracket|in, en, an, on, un}}.

Sango has three [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]: low, mid, and high. In standard orthography, low tone is unmarked, {{angle bracket|e}}, mid tone is marked with [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], {{angle bracket|ë}}, and high tone with [[circumflex]], {{angle bracket|ê}}: ''do-re-mi'' would be written {{angle bracket|do-rë-mî}}.

Sango has little written material apart from religious literature, but some basic literacy material has been developed.<ref name="karan12.7">{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.7 Sango literature}}</ref>

== Learning ==
Sango is considered unusually easy to learn; according to Samarin, "with application a student ought to be able to speak the language in about three months." However, reaching true fluency takes much longer, as with any other language.

For English-speakers there are two main difficulties. One must remember not to split double consonants: [[Bambari]], for example, must be pronounced ba-mba-ri, not bam-ba-ri. Also, as with any other tonal language, one must learn not to vary the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] according to the context. For example, if one pronounces a question with a rising tone as in English, one may inadvertently be saying an entirely different and inappropriate Sango word at the end of the sentence.
