==Linguistic Format==
In the journal [[Natural Language & Linguistic Theory]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stiebels|first1=B|title=Agent Focus in Mayan Languages|journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory|date=May 2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=501–570|jstor=27642832|doi=10.1007/s11049-005-0539-9|s2cid=170887874}}</ref> it is noted that if subjects are realized as negative indefinite pronouns, they may also trigger agent focus. The Mayan languages differ with respect to the degree of how obligation for agent focus. In this case Poqomam's agent focus is optional in all relevant contexts.

==Language Revitalization ==
According to [[American Anthropologist]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=England|first1=Nora|title=Mayan Language Revival and Revitalization Politics: Linguists and Linguistic Ideologies|journal=American Anthropologist|date=December 2003|volume=105|issue=4|pages=733–743|jstor=3567138|doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.4.733}}</ref> the revitalization of Mayan languages in Guatemala has increased in importance. In the [[1996 Peace Accords]] the idea of officializing or co-officializing Mayan languages was introduced. Unfortunately in the 1999 referendum of the constitutional changes it was turned down. In May 2003, the Guatemala congress passed the "[[Law of National Languages]]" that, while it states that Spanish is the official language of Guatemala, the Law recognizes that indigenous languages are essential parts of the national identity which must be promoted. This is a considerable change from the Guatemalan Constitution, which only recognizes indigenous languages as a part of the "national patrimony."

The Mayans have taken a number of actions that are intended, in part, to address the problem of language status and language shift:
# The establishment of the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]] is an autonomous state institution directed by Mayas.
# The Academia's establishment of linguistic communities corresponds to the 21 Guatemalan [[Mayan languages]].
# The finding of several [[NGO]]s will be devoted to linguistic research by Mayas.
# There will be an establishment of at least one foundation that addresses the community for language promotion.
# There will be an increment of numbers of Mayas who are involved in the [[Ministry of Education]] bilingual education programs.
# There will be an establishment of private "Maya schools" that will be intended to deliver appropriate education for Maya children.
# There will be an organization of nongovernmental associations to support the Maya schools.
# There will be an establishment of several Maya presses that promote publication in and about Mayan languages as well as other issues of concern.
