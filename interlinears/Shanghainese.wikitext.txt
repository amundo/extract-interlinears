'''Shanghainese''', also known as the '''Shanghai language''', '''Shanghai dialect''', or '''Hu language''', is a [[Wu Chinese]] language spoken in the [[Districts of Shanghai|central districts]] of the [[Shanghai|City of Shanghai]] and its surrounding areas. It is classified as part of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]]. Shanghainese, like the rest of the Wu language group, is [[mutually unintelligible]] with other [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].<ref>{{britannica|112557|Chinese languages}}</ref>

Shanghainese belongs to the [[Taihu Wu]] subgroup and contains vocabulary and expressions from the entire Taihu Wu area of southern [[Jiangsu]] and northern [[Zhejiang]]. With nearly 14 million speakers, Shanghainese is also the largest single form of Wu Chinese. It previously served as the [[lingua franca]] of the entire [[Yangtze River Delta]] region, but in recent decades its status has declined relative to Mandarin, which most Shanghainese speakers speak today as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Yiya |last2=Gussenhoven |first2=Carlos |title=Shanghai Chinese |journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association |date=2015 |volume=45 |issue=3 |page=321 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26352263 |issn=0025-1003}}</ref>

Shanghainese is rich in [[vowel]]s {{IPA|[i y ɪ ʏ e ø ɛ ə ɐ a ɑ ɔ ɤ o ʊ u]}} (twelve of which are [[Phoneme|phonemic]]) and in consonants. Like other Taihu Wu dialects, Shanghainese has [[voiced]] [[Initial (linguistics)|initials]] {{IPA|[b d ɡ ɦ z v dʑ ʑ]}}: neither [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] nor [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] has voiced initial [[Stop consonants|stops]] or [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. The Shanghainese tonal system is also significantly different from other Chinese varieties, sharing more similarities with the [[Japanese pitch accent]], with two level tonal contrasts (high and low), whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are typical of [[Tone (linguistics)#Register tones and contour tones|contour tonal languages]].

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=July 2011}}
Shanghai did not become a regional center of commerce until it was opened to foreign investment during the late [[Qing dynasty]]. Consequently, languages and dialects spoken around Shanghai had long been subordinate to those spoken around [[Jiaxing]] and later [[Suzhounese|Suzhou]]. In fact "speakers of other Wu dialects traditionally treat the Shanghai vernacular somewhat contemptuously as a mixture of Suzhou and Ningbo dialects."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moser |first=Leo J. |title=The Chinese Mosaic: The Peoples and Provinces of China |date=1985 |publisher=Westview |location=Boulder, Colo. |page=149 |language=en}}</ref> In the late 19th century, most vocabulary of the Shanghai area had been a hybrid between Southern Jiangsu and [[Ningbo dialect|Ningbonese]].<ref name="China Newsweek">{{Cite news |date=2005-10-17 |title=Shān'ào zhōng de Shànghǎihuà |script-title=zh:山坳中的上海话 |language=zh |work=Zhōngguó xīnwén zhōukān |url=http://www.chinanewsweek.com.cn/2005-10-24/1/6473.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314053721/http://www.chinanewsweek.com.cn/2005-10-24/1/6473.html |archive-date=March 14, 2008 |script-website=zh:中国新闻周刊}}</ref> Since the 1850s, owing to the growth of Shanghai's economy, Shanghainese has become one of the fastest-developing languages of the Wu Chinese subgroup, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing [[Suzhou dialect|Suzhounese]] as the [[prestige dialect]] of the [[Yangtze River Delta]] region. It underwent sustained growth that reached a hiatus in the 1930s during the [[Republic of China|Republican era]], when migrants arrived in Shanghai and immersed themselves in the local tongue.

After 1949, the new [[People's Republic of China]] government imposed [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin (Putonghua)]] as the official language of the whole nation of China. The dominance and influence of Shanghainese began to wane slightly. Since [[Chinese economic reform]] began in 1978, especially, Shanghai became home to a great number of migrants from all over the country. Due to the national prominence of Mandarin, learning Shanghainese was no longer necessary for migrants, because those educated after the 1950s could generally communicate in Mandarin. However, Shanghainese remained a vital part of the city's culture and retained its prestige status within the local population. In the 1990s, it was still common for local radio and television broadcasts to be in Shanghainese. In 1995, the TV series ''[[Sinful Debt]]'' featured extensive Shanghainese dialogue; when it was broadcast outside Shanghai (mainly in adjacent Wu-speaking provinces) [[Subtitle (captioning)#East Asia|Mandarin subtitles]] were added. The Shanghainese TV series ''Lao Niang Jiu'' (Old Uncle) was broadcast from 1995 to 2007<ref>{{citation |title=Chinese Wikipedia page of Lao Niang Jiu 老娘舅<!--|url=:zh-tw:老娘舅--> |publisher=Wikipedia}}.</ref> and was popular among Shanghainese residents. Shanghainese programming has since slowly declined amid [[Regional discrimination in China|regionalist/localist]] accusations.

From 1992 onward, Shanghainese use was discouraged in schools, and many children native to Shanghai can no longer speak Shanghainese.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zat Liu |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Is Shanghai's Local Dialect, and Culture, in Crisis? |url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903072555/http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262 |archive-date=September 3, 2011 |access-date=June 5, 2011 |website=CNNGo |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In addition, Shanghai's emergence as a cosmopolitan global city consolidated the status of Mandarin as the standard language of business and services, at the expense of the local language.<ref name="China Newsweek" />

Since 2005, new movements have emerged to protect Shanghainese from fading away. At municipal legislative discussions in 2005, former [[Shanghai opera]] actress Ma Lili moved to "protect" the language, stating that she was one of the few remaining Shanghai opera actresses who still retained authentic classic Shanghainese pronunciation in their performances. Shanghai's former party boss [[Chen Liangyu]], a native Shanghainese himself, reportedly supported her proposal.<ref name="China Newsweek" /> There have been talks of re-integrating Shanghainese into pre-kindergarten education, because many children are unable to speak any Shanghainese. A citywide program was introduced by the city government's language committee in 2006 to record native speakers of different Shanghainese varieties for archival purposes and, by 2010, many Shanghainese-language programs were running.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Xu |first1=Chi |last2=Liang |first2=Yiwen |date=2010-04-07 |title=Call Goes Out: Language, Please |language=en |work=Shanghai Daily |url=https://archive.shine.cn/metro/entertainment-and-culture/Call-goes-out-Language-please/shdaily.shtml |access-date=2021-06-03}}</ref>

The Shanghai government has begun to reverse its course and seek fluent speakers of authentic Shanghainese, but only two out of thirteen recruitment stations have found traditional Shanghainese speakers; the rest of the 14 million people of Shanghai speak modern Shanghainese,{{clarify|date=August 2016}} and it has been predicted that local variants will be wiped out. Professor [[Qian Nairong]] is working on efforts to save the language.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 22, 2010 |title=Shanghai Struggles to Save Disappearing Dialect |url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/you-think-youre-speaking-shanghainese-not-so-fast-666815 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125134720/http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/you-think-youre-speaking-shanghainese-not-so-fast-666815 |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |access-date=January 18, 2011 |website=CNNGO |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ap |first=Tiffany |date=November 18, 2010 |title=That Ain't Shanghainese You're Speaking |language=en |work=Shanghaiist |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2010/11/18/that_aint_shanghainese_youre_speaki.php |url-status=live |access-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328215608/http://shanghaiist.com/2010/11/18/that_aint_shanghainese_youre_speaki.php |archive-date=March 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In response to criticism, Qian reminds people that Shanghainese was once fashionable, saying, "the popularization of Mandarin doesn't equal the ban of dialects.

Fourteen native Shanghainese speakers had audio recordings made of their Shanghainese on May 31, 2011.

== Chinese policy toward Shanghainese ==
[[Han Chinese]], who make up 90% of the Chinese population, speak seven topolect groups that each contain many subdivisions and are not mutually intelligible. The remaining 10% of people, who belong to [[Ethnic minorities in China|minor ethnic groups]], speak more than 300 languages. Before the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], there were already attempts to establish a common language system. Therefore, the language issue has always been an important part of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] policy. Other than the government language-management efforts, the rate of rural-to-urban migration in China has also accelerated the shift to [[Standard Chinese|Putonghua]] and the disappearance of native languages and dialects in the urban areas.<ref name="Spolsky 2014">{{Cite journal |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |date=2014 |title=Language Management in the People's Republic of China |url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/02e_90.4Spolsky.pdf |journal=Linguistic Society of America |language=en |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=e165–e179 |doi=10.1353/lan.2014.0075|s2cid=73632643 }}</ref>

As more people moved into Shanghai, the economic center of China, Shanghainese has been threatened despite it originally being a strong topolect of [[Wu Chinese]]. According to Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, the population of Shanghai was estimated to be 24.28 million in 2019, of whom 14.5 million are permanent residents and 9.77 million are migrant residents.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-09 |title=2019 nián Shànghǎi Shì guómín jīngjì hé shèhuì fāzhǎn tǒngjì gōngbào |script-title=zh:2019年上海市国民经济和社会发展统计公报 |trans-title=2019 Shanghai Municipal Economics and Social Development Statistical Report |url=http://tjj.sh.gov.cn/tjgb/20200329/05f0f4abb2d448a69e4517f6a6448819.html |url-status=live |access-date=2021-02-27 |website=Shànghǎi Shì tǒngjì jú |script-website=zh:上海市统计局}}</ref> To have better communication with foreign residents and develop a top-level financial center among the world, the promotion of the official language, Standard Mandarin, became very important. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government banned the use of Shanghainese in public places, schools, and work.<ref name="Spolsky 2014" />

A survey of students from the primary school in 2010 indicated that 52.3% of students believed Mandarin is easier than Shanghainese for communication, and 47.6% of the students choose to speak Mandarin because it is a mandatory language at school. Furthermore, 68.3% of the students are more willing to study Mandarin, but only 10.2% of the students are more willing to study Shanghainese.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last=Fang|first=Na|title=Study of Attitudes to Shanghai Dialect and Mandarin in Shanghai Elementary School|url=https://www.ixueshu.com/document/cbdda1caac6215c2fb4d642bd7a6d00a318947a18e7f9386.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-27|website=www.ixueshu.com}}</ref>

Many youth can no longer speak Shanghainese fluently because they had no chance to practice it at school. Also, they were unwilling to communicate with their parents in Shanghainese, which has accelerated its decline.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zuo|first=Xinyi|title=Proceedings of the 2020 3rd International Conference on Humanities Education and Social Sciences (ICHESS 2020)|date=2020-12-16|chapter=Effects of Ways of Communication on the Preservation of Shanghai Dialect|chapter-url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/ichess-20/125949177|language=en|publisher=Atlantis Press|pages=56–59|doi=10.2991/assehr.k.201214.465|isbn=978-94-6239-301-1|s2cid=234515573}}</ref> The survey in 2010 indicated that 62.6% of primary school students use Mandarin as the first language at home, but only 17.3% of them use Shanghainese to communicate with their parents.<ref name=":12" />

==Intelligibility and variations==
[[File:Wu Dialects.png|thumb|300px|Map of dialects of Wu: Shanghainese is in dark red, in the top-right]]
{{original research|section|date=August 2017}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Shanghainese is part of the larger [[Wu Chinese]] group of Chinese languages. It is not mutually intelligible with any dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese]], or [[Cantonese]], [[Southern Min]] (such as [[Hokkien language|Hokkien-Taiwanese]]), and any other Chinese languages outside Wu. Modern Shanghainese, however, has been influenced by standard Chinese. That makes the Shanghainese spoken by young people in the city different from that spoken by the older population. Also, the practice of inserting Mandarin or both into Shanghainese conversations is very common, at least for young people.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Like most subdivisions of Chinese, it is easier for a local speaker to understand Mandarin than it is for a Mandarin speaker to understand the local language.

Shanghainese is somewhat similar to the speech of neighboring cities of [[Changshu]], [[Jiaxing]] and [[Suzhou]], categorized into Su-Hu-Jia dialect subgroup (苏沪嘉小片) of Wu Chinese by linguists. People mingling between those areas do not need to [[code-switching|code-switch]] to Mandarin when they speak to each other. However, there are noticeable tonal and phonological changes, which do not impede intelligibility. As the dialect continuum of Wu continues to further distances, however, significant changes occur in phonology and lexicon to the point that it is no longer possible to converse intelligibly. Most Shanghainese speakers find that by [[Wuxi]], differences become significant and that the [[Wuxi dialect]] would take weeks to months for a Shanghainese-speaker to learn fully. Similarly, [[Hangzhou dialect]] is understood by most Shanghainese-speakers, but it is considered "rougher" and does not have as much glide and flow in comparison. The language evolved in and around [[Taizhou, Zhejiang]], where it becomes difficult for a Shanghainese speaker to comprehend. [[Wenzhounese]], spoken in the southernmost part of [[Zhejiang]] province, is considered part of the Wu group but mutually unintelligible with Shanghainese.

==Phonology==

Following conventions of Chinese syllable structure, Shanghainese syllables can be divided into [[Syllable onset|initials]] and finals. The initial occupies the first part of the syllable. The final occupies the second part of the syllable and can be divided further into an optional medial and an obligatory [[Syllable rime|rime]] (sometimes spelled ''rhyme''). Tone is also a feature of the syllable in Shanghainese.<ref name="Zhu">{{cite book|last=Zhu|first=Xiaonong|title=A Grammar of Shanghai Wu|publisher=Lincom|date=2006}}</ref>{{rp|6–16}} Syllabic tone, which is typical to the other Sinitic languages, has largely become verbal tone in Shanghainese.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Shanghainese has a set of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[voiceless]] [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[voiced]] [[plosive]]s and [[affricate]]s, as well as a set of [[voiceless]] and [[voiced]] [[fricative]]s. [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|Alveolo-palatal]] initials are also present in Shanghainese.

Voiced stops are phonetically voiceless with slack voice phonation in stressed, word initial position.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ladefoged |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Ladefoged |last2=Maddieson |first2=Ian |author-link2=Ian Maddieson |title=[[The Sounds of the World's Languages]] |date=February 1996 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=0-631-19814-8 |pages=64–66}}</ref> This phonation (often referred to as murmur) also occurs in zero onset syllables, syllables beginning with [[fricatives]], and syllables beginning with [[sonorants]].

The transcriptions used above are broad and the following points are of note when pertaining to actual pronunciation:<ref name="Chen Gussenhoven"/>
* {{IPA|/u, o/}} are similar in pronunciation, differing slightly in lip rounding ({{IPA|[ɯ̽ᵝ, ʊ]}} respectively). {{IPA|/i, jɛ/}} are also similar in pronunciation, differing slightly in vowel height ({{IPA|[i, i̝]}} respectively). These two pairs are each merged{{specify|reason=Into what?|date=March 2021}} in younger generations.
* Many in younger generations diphthongize {{IPA|/e, ɤ/}} to {{IPA|[ei, ɤɯ]}}.
* {{IPA|/j/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɥ]}} before rounded vowels.

The [[Middle Chinese]] {{IPA|[-ŋ]}} [[Syllable rime|rime]]s are retained, while {{IPA|[-n]}} and {{IPA|[-m]}} are either retained or have disappeared in Shanghainese. Middle Chinese {{IPA|[-p -t -k]}} rimes have become glottal stops, {{IPA|[-ʔ]}}.<ref>Svantesson, Jan-Olof. "Shanghai Vowels," ''Lund University, Department of Linguistics, Working Papers,'' 35:191–202</ref>

===Tones===

Shanghainese has five phonetically distinguishable tones for single syllables said in isolation. These tones are illustrated below in Chao tone names. In terms of Middle Chinese tone designations, the ''yin'' tone category has three tones (''yinshang'' and ''yinqu'' tones have merged into one tone), while the ''yang'' category has two tones (the ''yangping'', ''yangshang'', and ''yangqu'' have merged into one tone).<ref>Chen, Zhongmin. ''Studies in Dialects in the Shanghai Area''. Lincom Europa, 2003, p. 74.</ref><ref name="Zhu" />{{rp|17}}

The conditioning factors which led to the ''yin–yang'' split still exist in Shanghainese, as they do in other Wu dialects: ''yang'' tones are only found with voiced initials {{IPA|[b d ɡ z v dʑ ʑ m n ɲ ŋ l ɦ]}}, while the ''yin'' tones are only found with voiceless initials.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The ''ru'' tones are abrupt, and describe those rimes which end in a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. That is, both the ''yin–yang'' distinction and the ''ru'' tones are [[allophone|allophonic]] (dependent on syllabic structure). Shanghainese has only a two-way phonemic tone contrast,<ref>Introduction to Shanghainese. [http://wu-chinese.com/zanhei/pitch.html Pronunciation (Part 3 – Tones and Pitch Accent)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301172616/http://wu-chinese.com/zanhei/pitch.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}</ref> falling ''vs'' rising, and then only in open syllables with voiceless initials.

====Tone sandhi====

[[Tone sandhi]] is a process whereby adjacent tones undergo dramatic alteration in connected speech. Similar to other Northern Wu dialects, Shanghainese is characterized by two forms of tone sandhi: a word tone sandhi and a phrasal tone sandhi.

Word tone sandhi in Shanghainese can be described as left-prominent and is characterized by a dominance of the first syllable over the contour of the entire tone domain. As a result, the underlying tones of syllables other than the leftmost syllable, have no effect on the tone contour of the domain. The pattern is generally described as tone spreading (T1-4) or tone shifting (T5, except for 4- and 5-syllable compounds, which can undergo spreading or shifting). The table below illustrates possible tone combinations.

As an example, in isolation, the two syllables of the word for ''China'' are pronounced with T1 and T4: {{IPA|/tsʊŋ˥˨/}} and {{IPA|/kwəʔ˦/}}. However, when pronounced in combination, T1 from {{IPA|/tsʊŋ/}} spreads over the compound resulting in the following pattern {{IPA|/tsʊŋ˥kwəʔ˨/}}. Similarly, the syllables in a common expression for ''foolish'' have the following underlying phonemic and tonal representations: {{IPA|/zəʔ˨˦/}} (T5), {{IPA|/sɛ˥˨/}} (T1), and {{IPA|/ti˧˦/}} (T2). However, the syllables in combination exhibit the T5 shifting pattern where the first-syllable T5 shifts to the last syllable in the domain: {{IPA|/zəʔ˩sɛ˩ti˨˦/}}.<ref name="Zhu" />{{rp|38–46}}

Phrasal tone sandhi in Shanghainese can be described as right-prominent and is characterized by a right syllable retaining its underlying tone and a left syllable receiving a mid-level tone based on the underlying tone's register. The table below indicates possible left syllable tones in right-prominent compounds.<ref name="Zhu" />{{rp|46–47}}

For instance, when combined, {{IPA|/ma˩˦/}} ("buy") and {{IPA|/tɕjɤ˧˦/}} ("wine") become {{IPA|/ma˧tɕjɤ˧˦/}} ("buy wine").

Sometimes meaning can change based on whether left-prominent or right-prominent sandhi is used. For example, {{IPA|/tsʰɔ˧˦/}} ("fry") and {{IPA|/mi˩˦/}} ("noodle") when pronounced {{IPA|/tsʰɔ˧mi˦/}} (i.e., with left-prominent sandhi) means "fried noodles". When pronounced {{IPA|/tsʰɔ˦mi˩˦/}} (i.e., with right-prominent sandhi), it means "to fry noodles".<ref name="Zhu" />{{rp|35}}

==Grammar==
Like all [[Sinitic languages]], Shanghainese is an [[isolating language]]<ref>Zhu, Xiaonong. ''A Grammar of Shanghai Wu''. LINCOM, 2006, pp.53.</ref> that lacks marking for tense, person, case, number or gender. Similarly, there is no distinction for tense or person in verbs, with word order and particles generally expressing these grammatical characteristics. There are, however, three important derivational processes in Shanghainese.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.53">Zhu 2006, pp.53.</ref>

Although formal [[inflection]] is very rare in all varieties of Chinese, there does exist in Shanghainese a morpho-phonological [[tone sandhi]]<ref>Quian, Nairon and Zhongwei Shen (1991). "The Changes in the Shanghai Dialect." ''Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series'' No. 3, pp. 405.</ref> that Zhu (2006) identifies as a form of inflection since it forms new words out of pre-existing phrases.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54">Zhu 2006, pp.54.</ref> This type of inflection is a distinguishing characteristic of all Northern Wu dialects.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54"/>

Affixation, generally (but not always) taking the form of suffixes, occurs rather frequently in Shanghainese, enough so that this feature contrasts even with other Wu varieties,<ref>Chao, Yuen Ren (1967). "Contrastive Aspects of the Wu Dialects." ''Language'' 43: 1, pp. 98.</ref> although the line between suffix and particle is somewhat nebulous. Most affixation applies to adjectives.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54"/> In the example below, the suffix -''deusir'' changes an adjective into a noun.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|geqtsung angsae-deusir veq-dae leq
|{this kind} disgusting-''deusir'' not-mention Q
|"Forget that disgusting thing!"<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.58.</ref>}}

Words can be [[Reduplication|reduplicated]] in order to express various differences in meaning. Nouns, for example, can be reduplicated to express collective or [[diminutive]] forms;<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54"/> adjectives so as to intensify or emphasize the associated description; and verbs in order to soften the degree of action.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54"/> Below is an example of noun reduplication resulting in semantic alteration.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|走走|tseutseu|walk-walk|"take a walk"}}

Word compounding is also very common in Shanghainese, a fact observed as far back as Edkins (1868),<ref>Edkins, Joseph. ''A Grammar of Colloquial Chinese, Shanghai Dialect''. Presbyterian Mission Press, 1868, pp.114.</ref> and is the most productive method of creating new words.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.54"/> Many recent borrowings in Shanghainese originating from European languages are di- or polysyllabic.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.56.</ref>

===Word order===
Shanghainese adheres generally to SVO word order.<ref>Han, Weifeng and Dingxu Shi (2016). "Topic and Left Periphery in Shanghainese." ''Journal of Chinese Linguistics'' 44:1, pp. 51.</ref> The placement of objects in Wu dialects is somewhat variable, with Southern Wu varieties positioning the direct object before the indirect object, and Northern varieties (especially in the speech of younger people) favoring the indirect object before the direct object. Owing to Mandarin influence,<ref>Quian and Shen 1991, pp.416.</ref> Shanghainese usually follows the latter model.<ref>Pan, Wuyun, et al (1991). "An Introduction to the Wu Dialects." ''Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series'' No. 3, pp. 270.</ref>

Older speakers of Shanghainese tend to place adverbs after the verb, but younger people, again under heavy influence from Mandarin, favor pre-verbal placement of adverbs.<ref name="Pan et al 1991, pp.271">Pan et al 1991, pp.271.</ref>

The third person singular pronoun ''xii'' (he/she/it) or the derived phrase ''xii ka'' ("he says") can appear at the end of a sentence. This construction, which appears to be unique to Shanghainese,<ref>Han and Shi 2016, pp.51.</ref> is commonly employed to project the speaker's differing expectation relative to the content of the phrase.<ref>Han, Weifeng and Dingxu Shi (2014). "The Evolution of ɦi23kã34 ('he says') in Shanghainese." ''Language and Linguistics'' 15:4, pp. 479.</ref> 
::''xii xii ka, ka veq ho'' 
::"Unexpectedly, he says no."<ref>Han and Shi 2014, pp.480.</ref>

===Nouns===
Except for the limited derivational processes described above, Shanghainese nouns are isolating. There is no inflection for case or number, nor is there any overt gender marking.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.53"/> Although Shanghainese does lack overt [[grammatical number]], the plural marker -''la'', when suffixed to a human denoting noun, can indicate a collective meaning.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.59">Zhu 2006, pp.59.</ref>
::''xuqsang-la xeq sir''
::"students' books"

There are no articles in Shanghainese,<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.59"/> and thus, no marking for [[Definiteness|definiteness or indefiniteness]] of nouns. Certain determiners (a demonstrative pronoun or numeral classifier, for instance) can imply definite or indefinite qualities, as can word order. A noun absent any sort of determiner in the subject position is definite, whereas it is indefinite in the object position.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.59"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|lae banxieu leq
|come friend P
|"Here comes a friend."}}

====Classifiers====
Shanghainese boasts numerous [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] (also sometimes known as "counters" or "measure words"). Most classifiers in Shanghainese are used with nouns, although a small number are used with verbs.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.71">Zhu 2006, pp.71.</ref> Some classifiers are based on standard measurements or containers.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.75.</ref> Classifiers can be paired with a preceding determiner (often a numeral) to form a compound that further specifies the meaning of the noun it modifies.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.71"/>
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|geqtsaq biidjieu
|this-CL ball
|"this ball"<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.74.</ref>}}

Classifiers can be reduplicated to mean "all" or "every", as in:
::''penpen''
::(CL-RD for "book")
::"every [book]"<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.76.</ref>

===Verbs===
Shanghainese verbs are [[Analytic language|analytic]] and as such do not undergo any sort of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] to express tense or person.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.82">Zhu 2006, pp.82.</ref> However, the language does have a richly developed [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] system, expressed using various particles.

====Aspect====
Some disagreement exists as to how many formal aspect categories exist in Shanghainese,<ref>Hashimoto, Mantaro J. "A Guide to the Shanghai Dialect." ''Princeton University Press'', 1971, pp. 521.</ref> and a variety of different particles can express the same aspect, with individual usage often reflecting generational divisions. Some linguists identify as few as four or six, and others up to twelve specific aspects.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.81">Zhu 2006, pp.81.</ref> Zhu (2006) identifies six relatively uncontroversial aspects in Shanghainese.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.81–2.</ref>

'''Progressive''' aspect expresses a continuous action. It is indicated by the particles {{transl|wuu|laq}}, {{transl|wuu|laqlaq}} or {{transl|wuu|laqhae}}, which occur pre-verbally.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.81"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|xii laq tsu kungkhu va
|he PROG do homework Q
|"Is he doing his homework?"}}

The '''resultative''' aspect expresses the result of an action which was begun before a specifically referenced timeframe, and is also indicated by {{transl|wuu|laq}}, {{transl|wuu|laqlaq}} or {{transl|wuu|laqhae}}, except that these occur post-verbally.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.82"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:|abbreviations=RES:resultative aspect
|pensir xuq laqhae jinglae phaxiongzang
|skill learn RES future take-advantage
|"Acquire the skill and take advantage of it later."}}

'''Perfective''' aspect can be marked by ''leq'', ''tsir'', ''hao'' or ''lae''. Notably, ''tsir'' is regarded as an old-fashioned usage.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.83">Zhu 2006, pp.83.</ref>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|iizong ma lae leq
|clothes buy PFV P
|"The clothes have been bought."}}
 
Zhu (2006) identifies a '''future''' aspect, indicated by the particle ''iao''.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.82"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|mentsao iao luqxy xeq
|tomorrow FUT fall-rain P
|"It's going to rain tomorrow."}}

Qian (1997) identifies a separate '''immediate future''' aspect, marked post-verbally by ''khua''.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.83"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|di'in saezang khua leq
|movie finish IMM.FUT P
|"The movie will finish soon."}}

'''Experiential''' aspect expresses the completion of an action before a specifically referenced timeframe, marked post-verbally by the particle ''ku''.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.84">Zhu 2006, pp.84.</ref>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ngu dao haelii chii xieuxiung xieu ku ngthong
|I to sea-inside go swim swim EXP five-times
|"I have swum the sea five times (so far)."}}

The '''durative''' aspect is marked post-verbally by ''xochii'', and expresses a continuous action.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.84"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|nung djieu njiang xii tsu xochii hao leq
|you even let he do DUR good P
|"Please let him continue to do it."}}

In some cases, it is possible to combine two aspect markers into a larger verb phrase.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.84"/>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|kungkhu tsu hao khua leq
|homework do PFV IMM.FUT P
|"The homework will have been completed before long."}}

====Mood and Voice====
There is no overt marking for [[Grammatical mood|mood]] in Shanghainese, and Zhu (2006) goes so far as to suggest that the concept of grammatical mood does not exist in the language.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.89">Zhu 2006, pp.89.</ref> There are, however, several modal auxiliaries (many of which have multiple variants) that collectively express concepts of desire, conditionality, potentiality and ability.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.89"/>

::{|
|-
| "can" || nen / nenkeu / hao
|-
| "be able" || ue / ueteq
|-
| "may" || khu'ii
|-
| "would like" || iao
|-
| "should" || inkae
|-
| "willing to" || zjinngjioe / ngjioe'ii
|-
| "happy to" || kaosjin
|-
| "want to" || sjiang / hao
|}

Shen (2016) argues for the existence of a type of [[passive voice]] in Shanghainese, governed by the particle ''be''. This construction is superficially similar to by-phrases in English, and only [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] verbs can occur in this form of passive.<ref>Shen, Alice. "A Tough Construction of the Shanghainese 'Passive.'" PhD qualifying paper, University of Berkeley, pp.1–3.</ref>

===Pronouns===
Personal pronouns in Shanghainese do not distinguish [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[Grammatical case|case]].<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.64">Zhu 2006, pp.64.</ref> Owing to its isolating grammatical structure, Shanghainese is not a [[pro-drop language]].<ref name="Pan et al 1991, pp.271"/>

There is some degree of flexibility concerning pronoun usage in Shanghainese. Older varieties of Shanghainese featured a different 1st person singular, {{transl|wuu|ngunjii}} or {{transl|wuu|njii}},<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.64"/><ref name="Hashimoto 1971, pp.249">Hashimoto 1971, pp.249.</ref> and newer varieties feature a variant of the 2nd person plural as {{transl|wuu|aqlaq}}.<ref name="Hashimoto 1971, pp.249"/><ref name="Chao 1967, pp.99">Chao 1967, pp.99.</ref> While Zhu (2006) asserts that there is no [[Clusivity|inclusive]] 1st person plural pronoun,<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.64"/> Hashimoto (1971) disagrees, identifying {{transl|wuu|aqlaq}} as being inclusive.<ref name="Hashimoto 1971, pp.249"/> There are [[Sociolect|generational and geographical distinctions]] in the usage of plural pronoun forms,<ref name="Chao 1967, pp.99"/> as well as differences of pronunciation in the 1st person singular.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.64"/>

Reflexive pronouns are formed by the addition of the particle {{transl|wuu|zirka}},<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.65.</ref> as in:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|xii tseqhao kua zirka
|he {can only} blame self
|"He can only blame himself."}}

Possessive pronouns are formed via the pronominal suffix -''xeq''.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.65–6.</ref>

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ||Singular||Plural
|-
!1st person
|nguxeq||aqlaxeq 
|-
!2nd person
|nungxeq||nnaxeq 
|-
!3rd person
|xiixeq||xiilaxeq
|}

===Adjectives===
Most native Shanghainese adjectives are monosyllabic.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.91.</ref> Like other parts of speech, adjectives do not change to indicate number, gender or case.<ref name="Zhu 2006, pp.53"/> Adjectives can take semantic prefixes, which themselves can be reduplicated or repositioned as suffixes according to a complex system of derivation,<ref>Pan et al 1991, pp.286.</ref> in order to express degree of comparison or other changes in meaning.<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.95.</ref> Thus:
::''lang'' ("cold")
::''pinlang'' ("ice-cold")
::''pinpinlang'' ("cold as ice")<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.93.</ref>

===Interrogatives===
The particle ''va'' is used to transform ordinary declarative statements into yes/no questions. This is the most common way of forming questions in Shanghainese.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|nong hao va
|2s good Q
|"How are you?" ({{lit}} "Are you good?")<ref>Myers, Ethan C. (2015). ''Sentence final particles in Shanghainese: Navigating the left periphery''. Master thesis, Purdue University, pp.15.</ref>}}

===Negation===
Nouns and verbs can be [[Affirmation and negation|negated]] by the particle ''mmeq'', whereas in most cases only nouns can be negated by {{transl|wuu|veqzir}}<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.59–60.</ref> or just {{transl|wuu|veq}}.<ref>Hashimoto 1971, pp.253.</ref> 
::''geq veqzir daetsir''
::(this not-be table)
::"This is not a table."<ref>Zhu 2006, pp.60.</ref>

==Writing==
[[File:Shanghai Phonetic Symbols.jpg|thumb|A table of Shanghai Phonetic Symbols by the Rev. J. A. Silsby]]

[[Chinese character]]s are used to write Shanghainese. [[Romanization]] of Shanghainese was first developed by [[Protestant]] English and American [[Christian missionaries]] in the 19th century, including [[Joseph Edkins]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Edkins|first=Joseph|date=1853|title=Grammar of the Shanghai Dialect}}</ref> Usage of this romanization system was mainly confined to translated [[Bible translations into Chinese|Bible]]s for use by native Shanghainese, or English-Shanghainese dictionaries, some of which also contained characters, for foreign missionaries to learn Shanghainese. A system of phonetic symbols similar to Chinese characters called "New Phonetic Character" were also developed by in the 19th century by American missionary [[Tarleton Perry Crawford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://serica.blog/2012/12/10/new-phonetic-character/|title=New Phonetic Character|date=December 10, 2012}}</ref>

Shanghainese is sometimes written informally using [[homophone]]s: "lemon" ({{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|níngméng}}), written {{linktext|檸檬}} in Standard Chinese, may be written {{linktext|人|門}} (person-door; {{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|rénmén}} in standard pinyin) in Shanghainese; and "yellow" ({{Zh|c=黄|s=|t=|p=huáng|labels=no}}) may be written {{linktext|王}} (meaning king; and {{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|wáng}} in standard pinyin) rather than the standard character {{linktext|黃}} for yellow. These are not homophones in Mandarin, but are homophones in Shanghainese. There are also some homophones in Mandarin which are not homophonic in Shanghainese, e.g. {{linktext|做}}, {{linktext|作}} and {{linktext|坐}}, all {{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zuò}} in Standard Mandarin.<ref>{{cite book

Protestant missionaries in the 1800s created the Shanghainese Phonetic Symbols to write Shanghainese phonetically. The symbols are a syllabary similar to the Japanese [[Kana]] system. The system has not been used and is only seen in a few historical books.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oldchinesebooks.wordpress.com/2012/12/|title=December – 2012 – SERICA|website=oldchinesebooks.wordpress.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220102901/https://oldchinesebooks.wordpress.com/2012/12/|archive-date=December 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/chineserecorder19lodwuoft|title=The Chinese recorder|first=Kathleen L.|last=Lodwick|date=May 10, 1868|publisher=Shanghai [etc.] T.
