'''Yanomaman''', originally transcribed '''Ya̧nomamö''' by [[Napoleon Chagnon]], simplified also as '''Yanomam''', '''Yanomáman''', '''Yamomámi''', and '''Yanomamana'''  (also '''Shamatari''', '''Shirianan'''), is a family of languages spoken by about 20,000 [[Yanomami|Yanomami people]] in southern [[Venezuela]] and northwestern [[Brazil]] ([[Roraima]], [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]]).

==Genetic relations==
Yanomaman is usually not connected with any other language family. [[Joseph Greenberg]] has suggested a relationship between Yanomaman and [[Macro-Chibchan languages|Macro-Chibchan]]. Migliazza (1985) has suggested a connection with [[Panoan languages|Panoan]] and Chibchan. Neither proposal is widely accepted.<ref name="Campbell-SAmerica">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |author-link=Lyle Campbell |editor1-last=Grondona |editor1-first=Verónica |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Lyle |date=2012 |title=The Indigenous Languages of South America |chapter=Classification of the indigenous languages of South America |series=The World of Linguistics |volume=2 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=59-166 |isbn=978-3-11-025513-3}}</ref>

==Name==
''Yanomami'' is not what the Yanomami call themselves and is instead a word in their language meaning "man" or "human being".  The American anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] adopted this term in the correct transcription ''Ya̧nomamö'' of its pronunciation to use as an [[exonym]] to refer to the culture and, by extension, the people. The word is correctly pronounced with nasalisation of all the vowels. As the phoneme indicated by the spelling 'ö' does not occur in English, variations in spelling and pronunciation of the name have developed, with ''Yanomami'', ''Yanomamö'', ''Ya̧nomamö'', and ''Yanomama'' all being used. Some anthropologists have used the spelling ''Yanomamɨ'' to indicate what they feel is a more correct indication of the pronunciation with the vowel {{IPAblink|ɨ}},{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} but because many presses and typesetters eliminate the diacritical marks, the incorrect pronunciation /i/ and spelling of the name with ⟨i⟩ has emerged.

==Characteristics==

===Phonology===
Yanomaman languages have a phonological distinction between oral and nasal vowels. There are seven basic vowel qualities: /a e i o u ɨ ə/, which can occur as oral or nasal sounds.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Yanomama Clause Structure|last=Ferreira|first=Helder Perri|publisher=LOT|year=2017|location=Utrecht}}</ref>

In the table above, the practical orthography is shown in angle brackets below the phoneme, if different.

The Yanomaman languages present extensive [[Consonant harmony|nasal harmony]]. When in Yanomaman words, a [[vowel]] is phonetically [[nasalized]], all vowels that follow within the same word are also nasalized. The consonants of Yanomama are shown in the table below:<ref name=":0" />

===Syntax===
Yanomaman languages are SOV, suffixing, predominantly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] with elements of [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]]. Its typology is highly [[polysynthetic]]. Adjectival concepts are expressed by means of stative verbs, there are no true adjectives. Adjectival stative verbs follow their noun.

There are five demonstratives which have to be chosen according to distance from speaker and hearer and also according to visibility, a feature shared by many native Brazilian languages such as [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] ones including [[Old Tupi]]. Demonstratives, numerals, classifiers and quantifiers precede the head noun.

There is a distinction between [[alienable and inalienable possession]], again a common areal feature, and a rich system of verbal classifiers, almost a hundred, they are obligatory and appear just before the verb root. The distinction between inclusive and exclusive 1st person plural, a feature shared by most Native American languages, has been lost in Yanam and Yanomam dialects, but retained in the others.

Yanomami morphosyntactic alignment is [[ergative–absolutive]], which means that the subject of an intransitive verb is marked the same way as the object of a transitive verb, while the subject of transitive verb is marked differently. The ergative case marker is ''-ny''. The verb agrees with both subject and object.

[[Evidentiality]] on Yanomami dialect is marked on the verb and has four levels: eyewitness, deduced, reported, and assumed. Other dialects have fewer levels.

The object of the verb can be incorporated into it, especially if it not in focus:

''Non-incorporated:''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|kamijə-ny sipara ja-puhi-i
|1sg-ERG axe 1sg-want-DYN
|'I want an/the axe'}}

''Incorporated:''
{{interlinear|indent=3
|kamijə-ny ja-sipara-puhi-i
|1sg-ERG 1sg-axe-want-DYN
|'I want [it], the axe'}}

Relative clauses are formed by adding a relativizing ('REL' below) suffix to the verb:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|wãro-n shama shyra-wei ware-ma
|man-ERG tapir kill-REL eat-COMPL
|'the man who killed the tapir ate it'}}

Sanuma dialect also has a relative pronoun ''ĩ''.
