'''Symmetrical voice''', also known as '''Austronesian alignment''', the '''Philippine-type voice system''' or inaccurately the '''Austronesian focus system''',<ref>See p. 188. Kaufman, Daniel. (2009). Austronesian typology and the nominalist hypothesis. In A. Adelaar & A. Pawley (Eds.), ''Austronesian Historical Linguistics and Culture History: A Festschrift for Robert Blust'' (pp. 187–215).</ref> is a typologically unusual kind of [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in which "one [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] can be marked as having a special relationship to the verb".{{sfnp|Blust|2013|p=436}} This special relationship manifests itself as a [[Voice_(grammar)|voice]] affix on the verb that corresponds to the syntactic role of a noun within the clause, that is either marked for a particular [[grammatical case]] or is found in a privileged structural position within the clause or both.

Symmetrical voice is best known from the [[languages of the Philippines]], but is also found in [[Taiwan]]'s [[Formosan languages]], as well as in [[Borneo]], Northern [[Sulawesi]], and [[Madagascar]], and has been reconstructed for the ancestral [[Proto-Austronesian]] language.<ref>Beguš, Gašper. (2016). [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/begus/files/begus_the_origins_of_voice_focus_system_in_austronesian_ws.pdf "The Origins of the Voice/Focus System in Austronesian"].

==Terminology==
The term ''Austronesian focus'' was widely used in early literature, but more scholars turn to the term ''voice'' recently because of the arguments against the term 'focus'.<ref>Himmelmann, N. P. (2002). Voice in western Austronesian: An update. In F. Wouk & M. Ross (Eds.), ''The History and Typology of western Austronesian voice systems'' (pp. 7-15). Canberra, ACT: Australian National University.</ref> On the other hand, Starosta argued that neither voice nor focus is correct and that it is a lexical derivation.<ref>Starosta, Stanley. (2002). Austronesian ‘Focus’ as Derivation: Evidence from Nominalization. ''Language and Linguistics, 3''(2), 427-479.</ref>

Schachter (1987) proposed the word 'trigger', which has seen widespread use. As one source summarized, 'focus' and 'topic' do not what they mean in discourse (the essential piece of new information, and what is being talked about, respectively), but rather 'focus' is a kind of agreement, and the 'topic' is a noun phrase that agrees with the focus-marked verb. Thus using those terms for Austronesian/Philippine alignment is "misleading" and "it seems better to refer to this argument expression as the ''trigger'', a term that reflects the fact that the semantic role of the argument in question triggers the choice of a verbal affix."<ref>Masumi Katagiri (2020) 'Tagalog'. In Tasaku Tsunoda (ed.) ''Mermaid Construction: A Compound-Predicate Construction with Biclausal Appearance.'' De Gruyter. P. 786.</ref>

==Studies==
A number of studies focused on the typological perspective of Austronesian voice system.<ref>Hemmings, Charlotte. (2015). Kelabit Voice: Philippine‐Type, Indonesian‐Type or Something a Bit Different? ''Transactions of the Philological Society, 113''(3), 383-405.</ref><ref>Liao, Liao, H. C. (2011). Some morphosyntactic differences between Formosan and Philippine languages. ''Language and Linguistics, 12''(4), 845-876.</ref>

Some explored the [[Semantics|semantic]] or [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] properties of Austronesian voice system.<ref>Kroeger, Paul. (2007). Morphosyntactic vs. morphosemantic functions of Indonesian –kan. In A. Zaenen et al. (Eds.), ''Architectures, Rules, and Preferences: Variations on Themes of Joan Bresnan'' (pp. 229-251).</ref><ref>Huang, Shuan-fan. (2002). The pragmatics of focus in Tsou and Seediq. ''Language and Linguistics, 3''(4), 665-694.</ref>

Others contributed to the [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]]-changing morphology.<ref>Fortin, Catherine. (2003). Syntactic and Semantic Valence: Morphosyntactic Evidence from Minangkabau. In ''Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society (BLS 29)''.</ref>

==Properties==
===Agreement with the semantic role of the subject ===
In languages that exhibit symmetrical voice, the voice affix on the main verb within the clause marks [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with "the [[Thematic relation|semantic role]] of the [subject]".<ref>Ross (2002, p. 20)</ref> 

For example, the Actor Voice affix may agree only with agent nominal phrases. (The asterisk means that the sentence is ungrammatical for the intended meaning.)

The sentences in (b) are ungrammatical because the agent nominal phrase is marked as the subject, even though the verb bears the locative voice affix. The sentences in (c) are ungrammatical because, instead of the location nominal phrase, the patient nominal phrase is marked as the subject.

===Types of semantic roles===
Across languages, the most common [[Thematic relation|semantic roles]] with which the voice affixes may agree are agent, patient, location, instrument, and benefactee. In some languages, the voice affixes may also agree with semantic roles such as theme, goal, reason, and time. The set of semantic roles that may be borne by subjects in each language varies, and some affixes can agree with more than one semantic role.

===Promotion direct to subject ===
Languages that have symmetrical voice do not have a process that promotes an [[Argument_(linguistics)|oblique argument]] to [[Object (grammar)|direct object]]. Oblique arguments are promoted directly to [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].

In the Tagalog examples above, the goal nominal phrase can either be an indirect object, as in (1), or a subject as in (2). However, it cannot become a direct object, or be marked with indirect case, as in (3). Verb forms, such as "nagpadalhan", which bear both an Actor Voice affix and a non-Actor Voice affix, do not exist in languages that have symmetrical voice.

The Tagalog examples contrast with the examples<ref>Taken from Shiohara (2012)'s examples in (4a-b) on page 60, and in (12) on page 63. Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> from [[Indonesian_language|Indonesian]] below. Indonesian is an Austronesian language that does not have symmetrical voice.

| father {ACTIVE VOICE}-send-APPLICATIVE 1SG money
| "Father sent me money."}}

In the Indonesian examples, the goal nominal phrase can be the indirect object, as in (4), and the subject, as in (5). However, unlike in Tagalog, which has symmetrical voice, the goal nominal phrase in Indonesian can be a direct object, as in (6). The preposition ''kepada'' disappears in the presence of the applicative suffix ''-i'', and the goal nominal phrase moves from sentence-final position to some verb-adjacent position. In addition, they can behave like regular direct objects and undergo processes such as [[Passive_voice|passivisation]], as in (5).

==Examples==
===Proto-Austronesian===

===Modern Austronesian Languages===
Below are examples of modern Austronesian languages that exhibit symmetrical voice.  These languages are spoken in [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Madagascar]].

The number of voices differs from language to language.  While the majority sampled have four voices, it is possible to have as few as three voices, and as many as six voices.  

In the examples below, the voice affix on the verb appears in <span style="color:#FF0000">red text</span>, while the subject, which the affix [[Selection_(linguistics)|selects]], appears in '''''<u>underlined bold italics</u>'''''.

Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref><ref>Abrams (1970, pages 1-2) indicates that Blaan verbs are classified into three types of ''prefocus bases'', each of which has an inherent voice without bearing any voice [[affix|affixes]].

A ''patient'' prefocus base is inherently in patient voice, and an ''instrument'' prefocus base is inherently in instrument voice.</ref><ref>Blaan has two morphemes which, when attached to a prefocus base, change the inherent voice of the base.  These morphemes are the Actor Voice affix, ''m-''/''-am-'', and the non-Actor Voice affix, ''n-''/''-an-''  ("subject focus" and "non-subject focus" in Abrams (1970, page 1)'s terminology, respectively).</ref> has four voices: ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', ''Instrument Voice'', and ''Non-Actor Voice''.

=====Kapampangan=====
[[Kapampangan_language|Kapampangan]]<ref>Taken from Mirikitani (1972)'s examples in (64), (95), (96), (100), (101) and (106). Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> has five voices:  ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', ''Goal Voice'', ''Locative Voice'', and ''Cirumstantial Voice''.

The circumstantial voice prefix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.

The direct case morpheme in Kapampangan is ''ing'', which marks singular subjects, and ''reng'', which is for plural subjects.  Non-subject agents are marked with ergative case, ''ning'', while non-subject patients are marked with accusative case, ''-ng'', which is [[Clitic|cliticized]] onto the preceding word.<ref>In the examples, the word to which the accusative case marker attaches is a pronoun or [[portmanteau]] pronoun that is obligatorily present in the same clause as the noun with which it is [[Coreference|co-referential]].  In sentences with an Actor Voice, the pronoun co-refers with the agent subject.  In sentences with a non-Actor Voice, the portmanteau pronoun co-refers with both the ergative agent and the non-agent subject, which is marked with direct case.</ref>

=====Tagalog=====
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] has six voices:  ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', ''Locative Voice'', ''Benefactive Voice'', ''Instrument Voice'', and ''Reason Voice''.

The locative voice suffix selects for location and goal subjects.  (In the examples below, the goal subject and the benefactee subject are the same noun phrase.)

The reason voice prefix can only be affixed to certain roots, the majority of which are for emotion verbs (e.g., ''galit'' "be angry", ''sindak'' "be shocked").  However, verb roots such as ''matay'' "die", ''sakit'' "get sick", and ''iyak'' "cry" may also be marked with the reason voice prefix.

The direct case morpheme, which marks subjects in Tagalog, is ''ang''.  The indirect case morpheme, ''ng'' /naŋ/, which is the conflation of the ergative and accusative cases seen in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, marks non-subject agents and non-subject patients.

=====Malagasy=====
[[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]<ref>Taken from Pearson (2005)'s examples in (2) and (10c). Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> has three voices: ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', and ''Circumstantial Voice''.

The circumstantial voice suffix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.

Malagasy does not have a direct case marker. However, the subject is found in sentence-final position.

==Non-Austronesian examples==
Alignment types resembling symmetrical voice have been observed in non-Austronesian languages.

===Nilotic===
The [[Nilotic languages]] are a group of languages spoken in the eastern part of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

====Dinka====
[[Dinka_language|Dinka]] is a [[dialect continuum]] spoken in [[South Sudan]]. The two dialects presented below each have a maximum of three voices. 

=====Agar=====
Andersen (1991) suggests that Agar exhibits symmetrical voice. This language has a maximum of three voices: ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', and ''Circumstantial Voice''. The subject is found in sentence-initial position, before the verb. The non-finite form of the verb found in the examples<ref>Taken from Andersen (1991)'s example (74) on page 286. Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> below is ''yḛ̂ep'' "cut".

{{interlinear|glossing=no abbr|number=(1)

| axe D-‹CV›cut 1PL.GEN tree
| "We are cutting the tree with the axe." (''or'' "The axe is being cut the tree with by us.")}}

However, the number of voice morphemes available in this language is reduced to two when the agent is a full [[noun]] (i.e., not a [[pronoun]]), such as in the examples<ref>Taken from Andersen (1991)'s example (71) on page 285. Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> below. In (5a), where the subject is a patient, and the agent is not a pronoun, the verb is marked with ''Circumstantial Voice''. Compare to (2) above, in which the agent is pronominal, and the verb is marked with patient voice morpheme, {{text color|#FF0000|ḛ́}}.

{{interlinear|glossing=no abbr|number=(4)

=====Bor=====
Van Urk (2015) suggests that Bor exhibits symmetrical voice. This language has three voices: ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', and ''Circumstantial Voice''.

The subject is found in sentence-initial position, before the verb. The non-finite form of the verb found in the examples<ref>Taken from van Urk (2015)'s example (2) on page 61. Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> below is ''câam'' "eat".

{{interlinear|glossing=no abbr|number=(1)

{{interlinear|glossing=no abbr|number=(3)

====Kurmuk====
Andersen (2015) suggests that [[Burun_languages|Kurmuk]], which is spoken in [[Sudan]], has a construction that resembles symmetrical voice. This language has three voices: ''Actor Voice'', ''Patient Voice'', and ''Circumstantial Voice''.

The subject in the examples<ref>Taken from Andersen (2015)'s example (1) on page 510. Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.</ref> below is found in sentence-initial position, before the verb.
