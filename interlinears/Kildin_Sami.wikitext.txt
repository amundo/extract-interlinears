'''Kildin Sami''' (also known as '''''Kola Sámi''''', '''''Eastern Sámi''''', and '''''Lappish''''', though the last is ambiguous) is a [[Sámi languages|Sámi language]] spoken on the Kola Peninsula of northwestern Russia that today is and historically was inhabited by this group.

==Geographic distribution==

[[File:Sami dialects and settlements in Russia map.svg|thumbnail|300px|Sami dialects and settlements in Russia:
{{legend|red|Kildin}} ('''K-5''' is Lovozero)
]]

The area around [[Lovozero (rural locality)|Lovozero]] has the highest concentration of speakers. It is the largest of the [[Eastern Sami languages]] by number of speakers. Its future, however, appears to be not as bright as that of [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] or [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] because the language is used actively by only very few people today. The Sami languages closest to Kildin are [[Ter Sami language|Ter Sami]] and [[Akkala Sami language|Akkala Sami]]. The latter is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Kildin Sami. Originally, Kildin Sámi was spoken in the mainland areas with the largest pockets of these people in clustered areas and in the coastal parts of the Kola Peninsula.<ref name=":0" /> Kildin Sámi speakers can be found in rural and urban areas, with one of them being in the administrative center of the Murmansk area.<ref name=":0" />

Kildin Sámi enclaves can be found throughout villages in Lovozero, Revda, Kola, Loparskaja, Teriberka, but can also be found in larger more sizable areas of Russia such as Olenegorsk and Apatity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wilbur |first1=Joshua |last2=Rießler |first2=Michael |year=2013 |title=Språk og språkforhold i Sápmi: Documenting the endangered Kola Saami languages |journal=Band |volume=11 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/skandinavistik/11/riessler-michael-39/PDF/riessler.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last1=Blokland |first1=Rogier |last2=Rießler |first2=Michael |year=2011 |title=Komi-Saami–Russian contacts on the Kola peninsula |journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics |pages=5–26 }}</ref> Lovozero is known as the area where the Kildin Sámi are dominantly present and where the language is still widely spoken amongst the small population: 700–800 ethnic Kildin Sámi among a total village population of approximately 3,000.<ref name=":0" /> Today, the language has only about 100 active and perhaps 600 passive speakers.<ref name=":0" /> As a result of relocation, migration, and forced movement of the group, the community has really fragmented and become divided over other areas in Russia, thus leading to an inability for the revival and sustenance of their language, traditions, customs, and beliefs.<ref name=":1" /> From a strictly geographical point of view, only Kildin and Ter, spoken on the Peninsula, should be regarded as Kola Sámi.<ref name=":1" />

==History==

===The early period ===
The Kildin Sámi (Kola Sámi) first came into contact and had more subsequent meetings with the Russians in the 12th century, when Pomor traders from the republic of Novgorod landed on the southern shores of the Kola Peninsula.<ref name=":1" /> Russians themselves inhabited and set up shelters in the Kola and the Ter Coast as it was known then during the 13th–14th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pineda |first=David |year=2008 |title=Куэссь не получается сāмас, рyшас полегче"–codeswitching on the Kola Peninsula |journal=Poljarnyj vestnik |volume=11 |pages=47–62 |url=http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/vestnik/article/viewFile/1301/1239 }}</ref> During the 15th and 16th centuries, Russians started heavily occupying and building their own communities in northern Karelia and increased exposure between the Kildin Sámi and Russians naturally blossomed as a result.<ref name=":1" /> In the 19th century, Kola Sámi were organized and advocated for themselves through "tight-knit familial communities" where they worked in pastures, lived by fishing, and survived through hunting all in a concrete set around defined territory with extended family.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Wheelersburg |first1=Robert.

Artes et linguae 16 |publisher=Örebro University |pages=392–421 }}</ref>

===The Stalinist era ===
During the 1930s, with an orientation toward Russian nationalism ("[[Russification]]") and Russian identity that came about more dramatically with Joseph Stalin's rise to power and his oppressive tactics, 20 years of repression, relocations, murders, and the extinguishment of certain languages came about, which had a quite negative influence on the Kola Sami languages and culture.<ref name=":4" /> As Stalins' reign went on in Soviet Russia, his paranoia, frustrations, anger, and delusions grew, emotions he would act on as leader. Resistance and refusal to submit to the collectivized farms, villages and working conditions of the reindeer Kildin Sámi community led to arrests by Stalin in the 1930s of those who lived in the Kola tundras.<ref name=":3" /> As Russia entered World War II, Kildin Sámi youth were drafted and impressed to serve in the Red Army, which lessened hardships and prejudices they faced for a temporary period.<ref name=":3" /> Although the repression ended after the death of Stalin in 1953, Russification policies continued and the work with the Sami languages started again only in the beginning of the 1980s when new teaching materials and dictionaries were published.<ref name=":4" />

===Current state===
As social and cultural emphasis has been put on the writing and speaking of the various languages that constitute Russia, Kildin Sámi has now become a critically endangered language.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Rießler |first=Michael |title=Towards a digital infrastructure for Kildin Saami |url=http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/sikriessler.pdf |year=2013 |journal=Sustaining Indigenous Knowledge: Learning Tools and community initiatives on preserving endangered languages and local cultural heritage|series=SEC Publications.

==Opportunities and challenges for the Kildin Sami==
===Opportunities ===
There is an opportunity to revitalize, reintegrate, and have Kildin Sami be more widely spoken such as reintroducing and raising awareness and support for Kildin Sámi as an everyday language for communication—like in the Sámi community of Lovozero.<ref name=":4" /> Youth and adolescents are expressing more interest now to speak Kildin Sámi which can help in the languages survival.<ref name=":4" /> A sizable portion of political and cultural Kildin Sámi groups are pushing for policies and local measures that help to maintain and protect Sámi tradition, which is important if the language is to survive the test of time.<ref name=":4" /> The federal Russian legislation guarantees the Sami several legal rights giving them language sovereignty and rights to use and develop their languages.<ref name=":4" /> But for the practical realization of these rights the Kola Sami community needs to hold a constant constructive dialogue with the municipal and regional authorities, which have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Sami in the development of the Sami language and culture.<ref name=":4" />

===Challenges ===
A majority of children remain ignorant of their traditional languages, customs and beliefs, and have had no formal or informal teaching which may give them a base of knowledge from which to work from.<ref name=":4" /> Antiquated materials, ineffective or inaccessible resources, and old teaching methods are often used to teach the language; there is no efforts towards the transmission of the language to future generations nor is there an active effort to preserve written language for scholarly use or to build opportunities to learn Kildin Sámi at higher levels.<ref name=":4" /> Although authorities and some government officials express a desire and willingness to resuscitate and revitalize the language, the community is not using that to their advantage, either because they do not know how to do so or whom to reach out to.<ref name=":4" /> There is no collaboration or team effort from language activists, language experts and language users and no coordinated or organized process to make learning the Kildin Sámi language a reality for more people.<ref name=":4" /> A language center or another initiative to carry out a more coordinated and well-planned language work could solve that problem.<ref name=":4" />

==Literature==
The printed item in Kildin were chapters 1-22 of the Gospel of Matthew published in 1897. It was translated with the help of native speaker consultants, in Cyrillic orthography by the Finnish linguist [[Arvid Genetz]], and printed at the expense of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]].  (The rest of the Gospel was in [[Akkala Sámi language]].)

==Writing system==
{{main|Kildin Sámi orthography}}

Kildin Sámi has been written in an extended version of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] since the 1980s. The alphabet has three variants with some minor differences among certain letters, mostly in '''Ҋ''' vs. '''Ј''' and '''’''' (apostrophe) vs. '''Һ'''. The Sammallahti/Khvorostukhina dictionary (1991) uses '''Ҋ''' and '''’''' (apostrophe); Antonova et al. (1985) uses '''Ј''' and '''Һ'''; a third orthographic variant, used by Kert (1986), has neither of these letters.

Note that the letters '''Ӓ''', '''Ҋ'''/'''Ј''', '''Һ'''/'''’''' (apostrophe), '''Ӆ''', '''Ӎ''', '''Ӊ''', '''Ӈ''', '''Ҏ''', '''Ъ''', '''Ь''', '''Ҍ''' and '''Ӭ''' do not occur in the word-initial position, either because the letters mark features of preceding consonants or the sounds they represent do not occur word initially. Therefore these letters do not normally occur in uppercase, except for [[all caps]] text.

The letter '''Щ''' occurs only in Russian [[loanword]]s.

The orthographic principles are more or less similar to Russian, but note the following special features.

===Palatalization ===
Similar to Russian, palatalization of a consonant in Kildin Sámi is marked by the letter [[Ь]] or one of the vowel letters '''Е''', '''Ё''', '''И''', '''Ю''', and '''Я''' following the consonant. Palatalized Д, Т, Н, however, are marked by [[semisoft sign|ҍ]] or one of the vowel letters '''Ӓ''' and '''Ӭ'''. The consonant letter Н before [[Ь]] or one of the vowel letters '''Е''', '''Ё''', '''И''', '''Ю''', and '''Я''' does not represent palatalization but the palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.

===Long vowels ===
Long vowels are marked with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] {{Angbr|¯}} over the vowel letter (and above the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in the cases of Ё).

===Preaspiration ===
The letter '''Һ''' occurs before the letters '''П''', '''Т''', '''К''', '''Ц''' and '''Ч''', and marks (historical) [[preaspiration]]. The actual pronunciation, however, varies between true preaspiration {{IPA|[ʰ]}} or the fricative sounds {{IPA|[h]}}, {{IPA|[ç]}}, or {{IPA|[x]}}.

===Voiceless sonorants ===
Voiceless sonorants are represented by the letters '''Ҋ'''/'''Ј''', '''Ӆ''', '''Ӎ''', '''Ӊ''', and '''Ҏ'''.

===Velar nasal===
The velar nasal is written as '''Ӈ'''.

== Grammar ==

=== Negation ===
In Kildin Sámi negation is formed by a [[Syntagma (linguistics)|syntagma]], which consists of a finite negative auxiliary and a finite main verb in a special case called ''connegative'' (negative form of the main verb). The negative auxiliary gets inflected by person, number and mood. The connegative is a case for the main verb in a negative clause. The tense (whether present or past) is marked by the main verb in a negative clause. The negative auxiliary has the same form in all tenses.

This is the inflectional paradigm of the negative auxiliary:

{| class="wikitable"

Negative clause in present tense:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clausal complementation in Kildin, North and Skolt Saami|last=Kotcheva|first=Kristina|last2=Rießler|first2=Michael|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2016|location=Berlin|pages=499–528|doi=10.1515/9783110416619-015a}}</ref>
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Mun   emm     t'ēd'   koal'e   Evvan   li   puadtma.
|I     I.not   know    koal'e   Ivan    is   come.
|"I don't know if/whether Ivan has come."}}

Negative clause in present tense:
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Sōnn   ejj       t'ēdtma   koal'e   sōnn   jo        ujjtma    li.
|s/he   s/he.not  knew.cn   koal'e   s/he   already   gone      is
|"S/he didn't know that s/he was already gone.'}}

With the negation of the verb "to be" in the third person it comes to an amalgamation of the main verb and the negative auxiliary:
* ''ell'a'' = "is not", compound of ''ejj'' (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and ''lea'' (connegative, present, main verb: "to be")
* ''jievla'' = "are not", compound of ''jiev'' (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and ''lea'' (connegative, present, main verb: "to be")
* ''ell'ij'' = "was not", compound of ''ejj'' (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and ''liijja'' (connegative, past, main verb: "to be")

In the third person plural of the past tense there is no amalgamation of the negative auxiliary and the main verb "to be":
* ''jiev liijja'' = "were not", compound of ''jiev'' (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and ''liijja'' (connegative, past, main verb: "to be")

Negative indefinite pronouns are formed with the negative prefix ''ni-''. It is the only prefix in Kildin Sámi and is borrowed from the Russian language. The prefix ''ni-'' can get used with all interrogative pronouns. The negative indefinite pronouns can stay in different cases. Some examples are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kildin Saami|last=Rießler|first=Michael|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2007|location=Berlin|pages=229–244|doi=10.1515/9783110199192.229}}</ref>
* ''ni-k'ē'' Neg-who? nominative, singular "nobody"
* ''ni-k'ējn'' Neg-who? comitative, singular "with nobody"
* ''ni-k'ēnn'' Neg-who? genitive, singular "nobody's"
* ''ni-mī'' Neg-what? nominative, singular "nothing"
* ''ni-mēnn'' Neg-what? accusative, singular "nothing"
{{interlinear|indent=3
|ni-mēnn    munn   emm     ujn
|what.not   I      I.not   see
|"I don't see anything."}}

== Loanwords to English ==
{{See also|List of English words of Sami origin}}

The word ''[[tundra]]'' has been borrowed to English, via Russian. In Kildin Sámi, {{lang|sjd|тӯндар}} (''{{lang|sjd-Latn|tūndâr}}'') means "treeless plain", but its [[genitive case]] is {{lang|sjd|тӯндра}} (''{{lang|sjd-Latn|tūndra}}'').
