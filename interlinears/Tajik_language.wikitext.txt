'''Tajik''' (Tajik: {{lang|tg|забо́ни тоҷикӣ́}}, {{lang|tg-Latn|zaboni tojikī}}, {{IPA-fa|zaˈbɔni tɔdʒiˈki|}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tgk|title=Tajik}}</ref> also called '''Tajiki Persian''' (Tajik: {{lang|tg|форси́и тоҷикӣ́}}, {{lang|tg-Latn|forsii tojikī}}, {{IPA-fa|fɔrˈsiji tɔdʒiˈki|}}), Tajiki, and Tadzhiki, is the variety of [[Persian language|Persian]] spoken in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] by [[Tajiks|Tajik people]]. It is closely related to neighbouring [[Dari]] with which it forms a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] of [[mutually intelligible]] varieties of the [[Persian language]]. Several scholars consider Tajik as a dialectal variety of Persian rather than a language on its own.<ref>Lazard, G. 1989</ref><ref>Halimov 1974: 30–31</ref><ref>Oafforov 1979: 33</ref> The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which [[Tajiks|Tajik]] intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, prominent intellectual [[Sadriddin Ayni]] counterargued that Tajik was not a "bastardised dialect" of Persian.<ref name=Ido>Shinji ldo.

By way of Early New Persian, Tajik, like [[Western Persian|Iranian Persian]] and [[Dari|Dari Persian]], is a continuation of [[Middle Persian]], the official religious and literary language of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of [[Old Persian]], the language of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] (550–330 BC).<ref>Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language”</ref><ref>in Frye, R.&nbsp;N., ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Vol. 4, pp. 595–632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref><ref name="EI">[[Frye, R.&nbsp;N.]], "Darī", ''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Brill Publications, CD version</ref><ref>[[Richard Foltz]], ''A History of the Tajiks: Iranians of the East'', London: [[Bloomsbury]], 2019, pp. 2-5.</ref>

In [[Afghanistan]] (where the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] minority forms the principal part of the wider Persophone population), this language is less influenced by [[Turkic languages]], is regarded as a form of [[Dari]] and as such has co-official language status. The Tajik of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and [[Iran]] due to political borders, geographical isolation, the standardisation process and the influence of [[Russian language|Russian]] and neighbouring Turkic languages. The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik (region of the old major city of [[Samarqand]]), which have been somewhat influenced by the neighbouring [[Uzbek language]] as a result of geographical proximity. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world, in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of [[Central Asia]].

==Name==
Up to and including the nineteenth century, speakers in Afghanistan and Central Asia had no separate name for the language and simply regarded themselves as speaking ''Farsi'', which is the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] for the Persian language. The term ''Tajik'', derived from the Persian for "foreigner", was an exonym used by Turkic speakers to refer to Persian speakers (the word [[Tat people (Iran)|Tat]] has a similar origin), although it has been adopted by the speakers themselves.<ref>Ben Walter, ''Gendering Human Security in Afghanistan in a Time of Western Intervention'' (Routledge 2017), p. 51: for more details, see the article on [[Tajik people]].</ref>

In 1989, with the growth in Tajik nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the [[national language|state (national) language]], with Russian being the [[official language]] (as throughout the [[Soviet Union|Union]]).<ref>In 1990 the Russian language was declared as the official language of [[USSR]] and the constituent republics had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions. See Article 4 of the [http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm Law on Languages of Nations of USSR.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |date=2016-05-08 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref> In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with [[Persian language|Persian]], placing the word ''Farsi'' (the endonym for the Persian language) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&pg=PA219&dq=tajikistan+alphabet+struggle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9_6nUJOlO5KQ0QGV_4D4Cw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tajikistan%20alphabet%20struggle&f=false ed.

==Geographical distribution==
The most important cities of [[Central Asia]]—[[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]]—are in present-day [[Uzbekistan]], where ethnic Tajiks comprise a majority.<ref name="diss">B. Rezvani: "Ethno-territorial conflict and coexistence in the Caucasus, Central Asia and

Tajik is still widely spoken in Samarkand and Bukhara today. Writing in 1996, [[Richard Foltz]] estimated that Tajiks might account for perhaps 70% of the total population of Samarqand and as much as 90% of Bukhara.<ref name=Foltz>Richard Foltz, "The Tajiks of Uzbekistan", ''Central Asian Survey'', 15(2), 213-216 (1996).</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/369.htm | title=Uzbekistan}}</ref> Later demographical trends are not clear.

Tajiks constitute 80% of Tajikistan's population and the language dominates in most parts of the country. Some Tajiks in [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] in southeastern Tajikistan, where the [[Pamir languages]] are the native languages of most residents, are bilingual. Tajiks are the dominant ethnic group in Northern Afghanistan as well and are also the majority group in scattered pockets elsewhere in the country, particularly urban areas such as [[Kabul]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Kunduz]], [[Ghazni]], and [[Herat]]. Tajiks constitute between 25% and 35% of the total population of the country. In Afghanistan, the dialects spoken by ethnic Tajiks are written using the [[Persian alphabet]] and referred to as [[Dari]], along with the dialects of other groups in Afghanistan such as the [[Hazaragi dialect|Hazaragi]] and [[Aimaq dialect]]s. Approximately 48%-58% of Afghan citizens are native speakers of Dari.<ref name="AFGHANISTAN v.

===Dialects===
Tajik dialects can be approximately split into the following groups:

# Northern dialects ([[Sughd Region|Northern Tajikistan]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[Varzob]] valley region of [[Dushanbe]]).<ref name="Windfuhr, Gernot 2009">Windfuhr, Gernot. "Persian and Tajik." The Iranian Languages. New York, NY: Routledge, 2009. 421</ref>
# Central dialects (dialects of the upper [[Zarafshan]] Valley)<ref name="Windfuhr, Gernot 2009"/>
# Southern dialects (South and East of [[Dushanbe]], [[Kulob]], and the [[Rasht District|Rasht]] region of Tajikistan)<ref name="Windfuhr, Gernot 2009"/>
# Southeastern dialects (dialects of the [[Darvaz (region)|Darvoz]] region and the [[Amu Darya]] near [[Rushon]])<ref name="Windfuhr, Gernot 2009"/>

The dialect used by the [[Bukharan Jews]] of Central Asia is known as the [[Bukhori dialect]] and belongs to the northern dialect grouping. It is chiefly distinguished by the inclusion of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] terms, principally religious vocabulary, and historical use of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Despite these differences, Bukhori is [[Mutual intelligibility|readily intelligible]] to other Tajik speakers, particularly speakers of northern dialects.

A very important moment in the development of the contemporary Tajik, especially of the spoken language, is the tendency in changing its dialectal orientation. The dialects of Northern Tajikistan were the foundation of the prevalent standard Tajik, while the Southern dialects did not enjoy either popularity or prestige. Now all politicians and public officials make their speeches in the Kulob dialect, which is also used in broadcasting.<ref>E.K. Sobirov (Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences). [http://www.iling-ran.ru/library/sborniki/for_lang/2014_06/4.pdf On learning the vocabulary of the Tajik language in modern times], p. 115.</ref>

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The table below lists the six vowel phonemes in standard, literary Tajik. Letters from the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet are given first, followed by IPA transcription. Local dialects frequently have more than the six seen below.

In central and southern dialects, classical {{IPA|/o̞/}} has chain shifted upward and merged into {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Beginners_Guide_to_Tajiki.html?id=3sNV38u-zBwC&redir_esc=y A Beginners' Guide to Tajiki]'' by Azim Baizoyev and John Hayward, Routledge, London and New York, 2003, p. 3</ref>

===Consonants===
The Tajik language contains 24 consonants, 16 of which form contrastive pairs by voicing: [б/п] [в/ф] [д/т] [з/с] [ж/ш] [ҷ/ч] [г/к] [ғ/х].<ref name="Khojayori, Nasrullo 2009"/> The table below lists the consonant phonemes in standard, literary Tajik.

===Word stress===
[[Word stress]] generally falls on the first syllable in finite verb forms and on the last syllable in nouns and noun-like words.<ref name="Khojayori, Nasrullo 2009"/> Examples of where stress does not fall on the last syllable are adverbs like: бале (''bale'', meaning "yes") and зеро (''zero'', meaning "because"). Stress also does not fall on [[enclitic]]s, nor on the marker of the direct object.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Tajik grammar}}
The word order of Tajiki Persian is [[subject–object–verb]]. Tajik Persian grammar is similar to the classical Persian grammar (and the grammar of modern varieties such as Iranian Persian).<ref>Perry, J. R. 2005</ref> The most notable difference between classical Persian grammar and Tajik Persian grammar is the construction of the present progressive tense in each language. In Tajik, the present progressive form consists of a present progressive participle, from the verb истодан, ''istodan'', 'to stand' and a cliticised form of the verb -acт, ''-ast'', 'to be'.<ref name=Ido />

{{fs interlinear|indent=3
|Ман мактуб навишта истода-ам
|man maktub navišta istoda-am
|I letter write be
|'I am writing a letter.'}}

In Iranian Persian, the present progressive form consists of the verb دار, ''dār'', 'to have' followed by a conjugated verb in either the simple present tense, the habitual past tense or the habitual past perfect tense.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. Persian Grammar: History and State of Its Study. De Gruyter, 1979. Trends in Linguistics. State-Of-The-Art Reports.</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|man dār-am kār kon-am
|I have work do
|'I am working.'}}

===Nouns===
Nouns are not marked for [[grammatical gender]], although they are marked for number.

Two forms of number exist in Tajik, singular and plural. The plural is marked by either the suffix -ҳо, ''-ho'' or -он, ''-on'' (with contextual variants -ён, ''-yon'' and -гон, ''-gon''), although Arabic loan words may use Arabic forms. There is no definite article, but the indefinite article exists in the form of the number "one" як, ''yak'' and -е, ''-e'', the first positioned before the noun and the second joining the noun as a suffix. When a noun is used as a [[direct object]], it is marked by the suffix -ро, ''-ro'', e.g. Рустамро задам (''Rustam-ro zadam''), "I hit Rustam". This direct object suffix is added to the word after any plural suffixes. The form -ро can be literary or formal. In older forms of the Persian language, -ро could indicate both direct and indirect objects and some phrases used in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and Tajik have maintained this suffix on indirect objects, as seen in the following example: (Худоро шукр, ''Xudo-ro šukr'' - "Thank God"). Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] does not use the direct object marker as a suffix on the noun, but rather, as a stand-alone [[morpheme]].<ref name="Khojayori, Nasrullo 2009"/>

==Vocabulary==
Tajik is conservative in its vocabulary, retaining numerous terms that have long since fallen into disuse in Iran and Afghanistan, such as арзиз (''arziz''), meaning "tin" and фарбеҳ (''farbeh''), meaning "fat". Most modern [[loanword|loan words]] in Tajik come from [[Russian language|Russian]] as a result of the position of Tajikistan within the [[Soviet Union]]. The vast majority of these Russian loanwords which have entered the Tajik language through the fields of socioeconomics, technology and government, where most of the concepts and vocabulary of these fields have been borrowed from the Russian language. The introduction of Russian loanwords into the Tajik language was largely justified under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] policy of modernisation and the necessary subordination of all languages to Russian for the achievement of a [[Communism|Communist]] state.<ref>Marashi, Mehdi, and Mohammad Ali Jazayery.

Bethesda, MD: Iran, 1994.</ref> Vocabulary also comes from the geographically close [[Uzbek language]] and, as is usual in [[Islam]]ic countries, from [[Arabic]]. Since the late 1980s, an effort has been made to replace loanwords with native equivalents, using either old terms that had fallen out of use or coined terminology (including from Iranian Persian). Many of the coined terms for modern items such as гармкунак (''garmkunak''), meaning 'heater' and чангкашак (''čangkašak''), meaning 'vacuum cleaner' differ from their Afghan and Iranian equivalents, adding to the difficulty in intelligibility between Tajik and other forms of [[Persian language|Persian]].

In the table below, [[Persian language|Persian]] refers to the standard language of Iran, which differs somewhat from the [[Dari|Dari Persian]] of Afghanistan. Two other Iranian languages, [[Pashto]] and [[Kurmanji|Kurdish (Kurmanji)]], have also been included for comparative purposes.

In Tajikistan and other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], Tajik Persian is currently written in [[Cyrillic script]], although it was written in the [[Latin script]] beginning in 1928 and the [[Arabic alphabet]] prior to 1928. In the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]], the use of the Latin script was later replaced in 1939 by the Cyrillic script.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. "Persian and Tajik." The Iranian Languages. New York, NY: Routledge, 2009. 420.</ref> The Tajik alphabet added six additional letters to the Cyrillic script inventory and these additional letters are distinguished in the Tajik orthography by the use of diacritics.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. "Persian and Tajik." The Iranian Languages. New York, NY: Routledge, 2009. 423.</ref>

==History==
According to many scholars, the New Persian language (which subsequently evolved into the Persian forms spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan) developed in [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], in what are today parts of Afghanistan, Iran, [[Uzbekistan]] and Tajikistan. While the New Persian language was descended primarily from [[Middle Persian]], it also incorporated substantial elements of other [[Middle Iranian languages|Iranian languages]] of ancient Central Asia, such as [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]].

Following the [[Arabs|Arab]] conquest of Iran and most of Central Asia in the 8th century AD, [[Arabic]] for a time became the court language and [[Persian language|Persian]] and other Iranian languages were relegated to the private sphere. In the 9th century AD, following the rise of the [[Samanid]]s, whose state was centered around the cities of [[Bukhoro]] ([[Buxoro]]), [[Samarqand]] and [[Herat]] and covered much of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northeastern Iran, New Persian emerged as the court language and swiftly displaced Arabic. Arabic influence continued to show itself in the form of the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] used to write the language (replaced in Tajik by Latin and then Cyrillic in the 20th century) and a large number of Arabic loanwords.

New Persian became the lingua franca of Central Asia for centuries, although it eventually lost ground to the [[Chaghatai language]] in much of its former domains as a growing number of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes moved into the region from the east. Since the 16th century AD, Tajik has come under increasing pressure from neighbouring [[Turkic languages]]. Once spoken in areas of [[Turkmenistan]], such as [[Merv]], Tajik is today virtually non-existent in that country. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] has also largely replaced Tajik in most areas of modern Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, Tajik persisted in pockets, notably in Samarqand, Bukhoro and [[Surxondaryo Province]], as well as in much of what is today Tajikistan.

The [[Russian Empire]] in [[Russian Turkestan]] implemented [[Turkification]] upon the Ferghana and Samarqand Tajiks, replacing the Tajik language with Uzbek; resulting in an Uzbek dominant speaking Samarqand, whereas decades before, Tajik was the dominant language in Samarqand.<ref name="NourzhanovBleuer2013">{{cite book|author1=Kirill Nourzhanov|author2=Christian Bleuer|title=Tajikistan: A Political and Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nR6oAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|date=8 October 2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|pages=22–}}</ref>

The creation of the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 helped to safeguard the future of Tajik, as it became an official language of the republic alongside [[Russian language|Russian]]. Still, substantial numbers of Tajik-speakers remained outside the borders of the republic, mostly in the neighbouring [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]], which created a source of tension between [[Tajiks]] and [[Uzbeks]]. Neither Samarqand nor Bukhoro was included in the nascent Tajik S.S.R., despite their immense historical importance in Tajik history. After the creation of the Tajik SSR, a large number of ethnic Tajiks from the Uzbek SSR migrated there, particularly to the region of the capital, [[Dushanbe]], exercising a substantial influence in the republic's political, cultural and economic life. The influence of this influx of ethnic Tajik immigrants from the Uzbek SSR is most prominently manifested in the fact that literary Tajik is based on their northwestern dialects of the language, rather than the central dialects that are spoken by the natives in the Dushanbe region and adjacent areas.

After the fall of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan's independence in 1991, the government of Tajikistan has made substantial efforts to promote the use of Tajik in all spheres of public and private life. Tajik is gaining ground among the once-[[Russification|Russified]] upper classes and continues its role as the vernacular of the majority of the country's population. There has been a rise in the number of Tajik publications. Increasing contact with media from Iran and Afghanistan, after decades of isolation under the Soviets, is also having an effect on the development of the language.
