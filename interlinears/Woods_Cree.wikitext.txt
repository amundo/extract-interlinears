'''Woods Cree''' is an [[autochthonous language]] spoken in Northern [[Manitoba]], Northern [[Saskatchewan]] and Northern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is part of the [[Cree language|Cree-Montagnais-Naskapi dialect continuum]].<ref name=e18>{{Ethnologue18|cwd}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Cree|url = http://www.languagegeek.com/algon/cree/nehiyawewin.html|website = www.languagegeek.com|access-date = 2015-11-26}}</ref> The dialect continuum has around 116,000 speakers;<ref name=cen16/> the exact population of Woods Cree speakers is unknown, estimated between 2,600 and 35,000.

== Classification ==
The Woods Cree language belongs to the [[Algic languages|Algic]] family, within the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] subfamily, and the central [[Cree language|Cree]]–[[Montagnais and Naskapi|Montagnais]]–[[Naskapi language|Naskapi]] language group.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Algic|url = https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/algic-0|access-date = 2015-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = E-MELD School of Best Practice: Potawatomi Family Tree|url = http://emeld.org/school/case/potawatomi/tree.html|website = emeld.org|access-date = 2015-09-30|date = 2006-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Languages of Native North America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ALnf3s2m7PkC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2001-06-07|isbn = 9780521298759|first = Marianne|last = Mithun}}</ref>

Western Cree is a term used to refer to the non-palatized Cree dialects, consisting of Northern Plains Cree, Southern Plains Cree, Woods Cree, Rock Cree, Western Swampy Cree, Eastern Swampy Cree, Moose Cree, and Atikamekw.
Western Woods Cree is the term used to refer to the Cree languages west of the Hudson Bay.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title = Handbook of North American Indians: Subarctic|url = https://archive.org/details/handbookofnorth008stur|url-access = registration|page = [https://archive.org/details/handbookofnorth008stur/page/256 256]|quote = Western%20Woods%20Cree.%20James%20G.E.%20Smith.|publisher = Government Printing Office|date = 1978-01-01|isbn = 9780160045783|first = William C.|last = Sturtevant}}</ref> This includes the languages Rock Cree, western Swampy Cree, and Strongwoods or Bois Fort Cree. James G.E. Smith classified the linguistic nature of the languages of Woods Cree, northern Plains Cree, western Swampy Cree, and the extinct dialect of Misinipi or Rock Cree to all fall under the Western Woods Cree languages.<ref name=":3" />

Another name for Woods Cree is Rocky Cree,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre|url = http://www.sicc.sk.ca/woodland-cree_overview_history.html|website = www.sicc.sk.ca|access-date = 2015-09-30}}</ref> translated by Rossignol (1939) from the Cree word asini•ska•wiðiniwak.<ref name="Smith 434–448">{{Cite journal|title = The Western Woods Cree: Anthropological Myth and Historical Reality|jstor = 644951|journal = American Ethnologist|date = 1987-08-01|pages = 434–448|volume = 14|issue = 3|first = James G.

In Alberta, Woods Cree is also known as Bush Cree.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian - volume 18 page 55|url = http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/curtis/viewPage.cgi?id=nai.18.book.00000091&volume=18&showp=2&size=2#nai.18.book.00000091|website = curtis.library.northwestern.edu|access-date = 2015-10-08}}</ref>

Precise classification of the Woods Cree language has not been sufficiently documented. Many different names and terms have been used in the description of the ''"th"'' dialect of Cree spoken in the forested area north of the [[Canadian Prairies|Canadian prairies]]. A more general, all-encompassing term for this dialect is "[[Woodland Cree]]", which also refers to the cultural group living in the forested area north of the prairies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Facts for Kids: Cree Indians (Crees)|url = http://www.bigorrin.org/cree_kids.htm|website = www.bigorrin.org|access-date = 2015-11-26}}</ref>  This term is used, for example, in separating the cultural groups of Cree people who live in the wooded area from the Plains Cree, who traditionally inhabited the prairies to the south.

The language portal of Canada has divided all Cree languages west of Ontario up until the Rocky Mountains into four main subgroups: Plains Cree, Swampy Cree, Moose Cree and Woods Cree. However, in referring to the Woods Cree language they use the terms Woodland and Rock interchangeably.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cree language facts for editors of English and French – Articles – From Our Contributors – Language Portal of Canada|url = https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/collaborateurs-contributors/articles/lang-crie-cree-lang-eng.html|website = www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca|access-date = 2015-11-27|first = Government of Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada - Translation|last = Bureau}}</ref> Whether these terms are interchangeable when referring to the Cree ''"th"'' dialect however has not been explicitly determined.

== History and Geographic Distribution ==
Different sources in Canadian history texts document the area in which Woods Cree was and still is spoken today. In the early 1900s, [[Joseph Tyrrell|J.B. Tyrrell]], a Canadian geologist and cartographer and the editor of explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]'s work<ref name="Smith 434–448"/> found that the people living in the area of [[Île-à-la-Crosse]] and upper [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] referred to themselves as ''Nahathaway'' and spoke the particular ''-th'' dialect of Woods Cre''e.'' The [[Archives of Manitoba|Hudson's Bay Company]] had made record of the area west of [[James Bay]] being inhabited by people speaking the ''-th'' dialect of Cree.<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com">{{Cite journal|title = the Western Woods Cree: anthropological myth and historical reality|journal = American Ethnologist|date = 1987-08-01|issn = 1548-1425|pages = 434–448|volume = 14|issue = 3|doi = 10.1525/ae.1987.14.3.02a00020|first = James G. E.|last = Smith}}</ref> This region of Woods Cree speakers has essentially remained the same until present.

Traditionally Woods Cree was often divided into western and eastern Woods Cree, reaching as far east as Quebec.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Native North America By Mark Sutton|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eshwCgAAQBAJ&q=woods+cree&pg=PA362|access-date = 2015-10-08|isbn = 9781317347217|last1 = Sutton|first1 = Mark Q.|date = 2015-08-26}}</ref> However, the actual Woods Cree language is now determined to be spoken in the mid-northern part of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Western Woods Cree is the category of Cree languages spoken west of the Hudson Bay and in the boreal forested area across the northern provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.<ref name=":3" />

===Demographics===
In 1982 [[SIL International|SIL]] (Summer Institute for Languages) found that the population of Woods Cree speakers was 35,000 people. More recently the University of Regina has documented that of the approximately 75,000 speakers of Cree across in Canada, 20,000 of them live in Saskatchewan, which is the main area where Woods Cree is spoken.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan {{!}} Details|url = http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/aboriginal_languages.html|website = esask.uregina.ca|access-date = 2015-10-08}}</ref> Not only is this finding much less than the 1982 statistic, but this estimation accounts for all types of spoken Cree, not just Woods Cree spoken in Saskatchewan. Also to consider is the Woods Cree spoken outside of Saskatchewan that is unaccounted for in this statistic. According to the [[2016 Canadian Census]] there were 1,840 individuals who identified Woods Cree as their mother tongue, and 2,665 individuals who  said they had some knowledge of Woods Cree. There were also 64,050 people who identified a non-specified dialect of Cree as their mother tongue, and 86,115 who said they had some knowledge of a non-specified dialect of Cree.<ref name=cen16/> Some of those individuals could be Woods Cree speakers.

=== Official Status ===
Woods Cree is not an official language of any country. Speakers of Woods Cree live in and around the northern, forested area of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Saskatchewan">{{Cite web|title = The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan {{!}} Details|url = http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/aboriginal_languages.html|website = esask.uregina.ca|access-date = 2015-10-06|first = Cory Toth - Encyclopedia Of|last = Saskatchewan}}</ref>

== Phonology ==

Like other western Cree languages and dialects, Woods Cree only contains seventeen different phonemes (sounds).<ref name="Saskatchewan"/> This is a fairly small phonemic inventory for a language; for example, Canadian English distinguishes thirty-eight phonemes. The following phonemes can be found in western Cree languages and dialects: /a, â, c, ê, h, i, î, k, m, n, o, ô, p, s, t, w, y/. Woods Cree differs only in merging /ê/ with /î/ (and thus decreasing the vowel inventory by one down to six distinct vowels) but adding "th" (/[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/) as the reflex of Proto-Algonquian *r (and thus maintaining a distinct phoneme that the other Western dialects have lost).<ref name="Saskatchewan"/>{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

=== Vowels ===
An important aspect of the Cree vowel system is that the Proto Algonquian short /e/ phoneme merged with short /i/ phoneme<ref name="Starks 102–115" /> as shown above. In Woods Cree the long /eː/ also has merged with the long /iː/ phoneme.<ref name="creedictionary.com">{{Cite web|title = Online Cree Dictionary, Cree Language Resource Project, Maskwacis Plains Cree, Saskatchewan Cree, Woods Cree|url = http://www.creedictionary.com/syllabics/woodland.php|website = www.creedictionary.com|access-date = 2015-10-16}}</ref> Phonetically, these two sounds may also alternate.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Starks|first=Donna Joy|title=Aspects of Woods Cree syntax|publisher=Ann Arbor: UMI.|year=1992}}</ref> This results in the vowel system of Woods Cree consisting of only three long vowels /iː uː aː/ and three short vowels /i u a/ in the entire language.
=== Nonpalatalized ''-th'' ===
The distinguishing feature of Woods Cree is the use of the nonpalatalized ''-th'' sound in places where other dialects of Cree would use a different sound: for example, [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]] is known for using the ''-y'' [[phoneme]]. This can be demonstrated by the Cree word for 'I'. In Woods Cree the word for 'I' is ''nitha'' (ni[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>a) whereas in Plains Cree it would be pronounced ''niya'' (nija) spelt '''ᓂᔭ'''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Search results|url = http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=niya&scope=1|website = www.creedictionary.com|access-date = 2015-10-05}}</ref> in [[Cree syllabics|Cree orthography]]. A significant distinction between Woods Cree and Plains Cree has been questioned in the analysis and history of the language. Various researchers and explorers throughout history however have concluded that there is a "loss of intelligibility between Woods Cree and Plains Cree",<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/> distinguishing them as separate languages.

==== Voiced Dental Fricative patterns ([[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]) ====

Cree /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ shares features both with obstruents and sonorants.<ref name="Starks 102–115">{{Cite journal|title = Woods Cree /ð/: An Unusual Type of Sonorant|jstor = 10.1086/430580|journal = International Journal of American Linguistics|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 102–115|volume = 71|issue = 1|doi = 10.1086/430580|first1 = Donna|last1 = Starks|first2 = Elaine|last2 = Ballard|s2cid = 143846492}}</ref> Many languages around the globe have been recorded using the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme and in most of these cases this phoneme is classified as an [[obstruent]]. However, the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme in spoken Woods Cree has resemblance to a [[sonorant]] phoneme. Most of the evidence demonstrated in the article even concludes that it would be more logical to classify this phoneme as a sonorant due to the following five factors: the sonorant realizations of the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme, the placement of the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme in the phonological inventory, the voicing patterns of this phoneme in non-word final positions, the usage of /l/ phoneme as a replacement for /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme in caregiver speech, and lastly the /l/ and /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme replacement of /r/ in English loan words.<ref name="Starks 102–115"/> In [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme of Woods Cree has been reconstructed as ''*l'' and, thus, also demonstrates its relation to being categorized as a sonorant. This analysis is challenged however by particular factors which show the likeness of /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ as an obstruent. For example, among younger speakers the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme is sometimes replaced by a /t/ and voicing in word-final positions also shows that it also falls under obstruent classification.<ref name="Starks 102–115"/> One reason for this particularly unique form of the /[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]/ phoneme as explained in the article is a possible phonological shift that is occurring in Woods Cree speech due to the influence of the English phonology on the language, however, the data is inconclusive due to the endangered status of the language.<ref name="Starks 102–115"/>

== Morphology ==
The Woods Cree morphological form follows a similar system to that of other Western Cree dialects (for example, [[Swampy Cree]] or Plains Cree). A more comprehensive examination of the Western Cree morphological system relating to Woods Cree can be found on the [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] Wikipedia page.

Cree languages are [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and can have single words that would need an entire sentence to properly be expressed in English.

For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ni-kî-nohtê-wâpam-âw-ak|c1=(note: hyphens here are present solely to demonstrate the separate [[morpheme]]s)
|1-PST-want-see.TA-3-PL
|"I wanted to see them." (animate)}}

Cree is also considered to be a highly [[Inflectional language|inflectional]] language with all of its inflection being [[suffixation]] with the exception of the four personal prefixes.

=== Third Person Indefinite Possessor ===

Woods Cree morphology follows the Western Cree system of morphology. Specific to Woods Cree is use of third person indefinite possessors than in other dialects of Cree. The [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] definite possessor prefix is reconstructed as ''*me-'' in Bloomfield (1946)<ref>.{{Cite journal|title = The Indefinite Possessor Prefix in Woods Cree|jstor = 1265261|journal = International Journal of American Linguistics|date = 1985-10-01|pages = 353–356|volume = 51|issue = 4|first = Robert A.|last = Brightman|doi=10.1086/465890|s2cid = 145445275}}</ref> Hamp (1976) expands on Bloomfield's analysis by finding in contrast *''we-'' to be the definite human/animal possessor and *''me-'' to be the indefinite possessor prefix.<ref name="Brightman 353–356">{{Cite journal|title = The Indefinite Possessor Prefix in Woods Cree|jstor = 1265261|journal = International Journal of American Linguistics|date = 1985-10-01|pages = 353–356|volume = 51|issue = 4|first = Robert A.|last = Brightman|doi=10.1086/465890|s2cid = 145445275}}</ref>

As found in other dialects of Cree, the following possessor prefixes are used in Woods Cree:

* '''''ni-''''' referring to first person possession (in English: 'my')
* '''''yi-''''' referring to second person possession (in English: 'your')
* '''''o-''''' referring to third person definite possession (in English: 'his/her')
* '''''mi-''''' referring to third person indefinite possession (in English: 'someone's')

In most dialects of Cree the prefix ''mi-'' is used when describing nouns regarding an undetermined body part, clothing items, and members of kin. For example, a pair of pants (noun requiring a possessor), undetermined in whom they belong to would be preceded with the ''mi-'' prefix. In Woods Cree the ''mi-'' prefix is not applied to members of kin as well as body parts unique to animals. This difference helps demonstrate the dialect difference between Woods Cree and other types of Cree. Plains Cree, for example, does apply indefinite third person possessors when referring to kin.<ref name="Brightman 353–356"/>

=== Future Markers ===

In [[Pukatawagan]] Woods Cree, specific usage of the future markers have been determined.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Future Markers in Woods Cree|last = Greensmith|first = Jennifer, M.|date = 1985|journal = Papers of the Sixteenth Algonquian Conference}}</ref>  Woods Cree spoken in this area, like other Cree dialects, uses the future markers ''ka-'' as the second person future marker.<ref name=":0" /> It has been agreed that this is a reduction of the second person prefix ''ki-'' and the future marker ''ka-''.<ref name=":0" /> The first person future marker ''na-'' however does not follow the same reduction patterns (combining ''ni-'' first person prefix and ''ka-'' future marker). It has determined instead to be a [[portmanteau]] realization of first person and tense categories.<ref name=":0" />

'''Phono-morphological characteristics'''

In vowel initial verb stems, Woods Cree will use a vowelless variation of the personal prefixes. For example, the verb ''a[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>ahwi:w'' 'he buries him' can use the vowelless, reduced version of the personal prefix ''nika-'' recognized as ''n-''. The verb then becomes ''n-''a[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>ahwi:w'''' ''''I am burying him'. WoodsCree generally uses the connective variant (as seen below) more frequently than the reduced version, however the reduced version is recognized within the language'''.<ref name=":0" /> '''

Cree verbs that begin with a vowel use the two different connectors ''-y-'' and ''-t-'' to join the prefix with the verb:<ref name=":0" />

: ''ni-t-apin''    'I am sitting down'
: ''ni-y-apin''    'I am sitting down

Both forms are equally acceptable. However, in Woods Cree the ''-y-'' connective is fully productive and can be used with nouns as well as verbs.<ref name=":0" /> This is unlike other dialects of Cree, for example, Plains Cree where the connective ''-t-'' is mainly used. In spite of using both connectives, the ''-t-'' connective is recognized to be the more common of the two.<ref name=":0" /> The use of ''-y-'' is also found to be in [[free variation]] with the reduced variant of the ''ki-'' prefix:

: ''ki-y-ayamihitona:na:w''    'we are talking to each other'
: ''k-ayamina:naw''    'we are talking'

In the reduced variant (as seen above: ''k-ayamina:naw'') the initial short vowel is not lengthened as in the non-reduced variant (''ki-y-ayamihitona:na:w)''.<ref name=":0" /> This reduction from ''ni-'' or ''ki-'' to the form ''n-'' or ''k-'' is unusual in the Cree language to be used in this manner. As found in Plains Cree, only ''o-'' initial verbs are allowed the free variation of using the ''-t-'' connective''.'' Also the lengthening of the initial vowel is only allowed in ''o-'' initial stems, as seen below:<ref name=":0" />

: ''otine:w''    'he takes him'
: ''n-o:tina:w''    'I take him'

When a verb beginning with a short vowel is used a trend can be seen in Woods Cree that elides the ''-i-'' vowel:<ref name=":0" />

: ''a[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>ahwi:w''    'he buries him'
: [[Voiced dental fricative|''n-að'']]''ahwi:w''    'I am burying him'

However, when determining the context of the situation, the initial vowel of the verb stem can be lengthened to portray the specific context:

: ''n-a[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>ahwi:w''    'I am burying him'
: ''n-a:[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]<nowiki/>ahwi:w''     'I will bury him'

In Woods Cree, when combining a word ending with a short vowel with a word beginning with a short vowel, the rule of [[external sandhi]] requires the final vowel of the first word to be dropped and the initial vowel of the second word to be lengthened:<ref name=":0" />

: ''awa'' + ''iskwi:w'' > ''aw i:skwi:w''    'this woman'

'''Independent/conjunct order preverbs'''

The independent order preverbs used in other dialects of Cree (Plains Cree and Swampy Cree) are ''ta-, kita-,'' and ''ka-''.<ref name=":0" /> In Woods Cree ''ta-'' and ''kita-'' only occur in the conjunct order''.'' In the independent order of Woods Cree the preverbs ''na-'' and ''nika-'' are used. The preverb ''ka-'' can be used in both the independent and conjunct orders. The preverb ''na-'' can be seen as a [[portmanteau]] morpheme, which expresses the first person future context. However, in the second person future context there is no ''kika-'' that correlates with the ''ka-'' morpheme.<ref name=":0" /> The independent order ''nika-'' is not commonly used in Woods Cree but is found in situations requiring repetition or clarification:<ref name=":0" />

: ''nika-pi:ha:w''    (after being asked to repeat comment) 'I'm going to wait for him'

The ''na-'' morpheme is classified as a portmanteau because it is a dental [n] and therefore it cannot be a reduced form of ''nika-'' when here the [n] assimilates with the following [k] ad becomes a velar nasal.<ref name=":0" />

Northern Alberta Cree (not specifically Woods Cree) has also been determined to use the plural suffix ''-wa•w-'' where all other Plains Cree speakers make use of the plural suffix -''ik-''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title = Sketch of Cree, an Algonquian Language, In: Handbook of North American Indians, Vol 17: Language|url = http://search.language-archives.org/record.html?id=rosettaproject_org_rosettaproject_crk_detail-1|website = search.language-archives.org|access-date = 2015-10-30}}</ref>

== Syntax ==

=== Grammar ===
Cree is a highly [[Inflection|inflected language]] and much of the syntactic expression happens within the [[noun]] or the [[verb]] itself.<ref name=":2" /> Due to the complex morphological characteristics of the Cree language, the syntactic [[word order]] is relatively free in comparison to many other languages. Free expression of discontinuous constituents is found in Cree, also referred to as [[Non-configurational language|non-configurational]]. For example, the sentence "the children killed some ducks" could be expressed in the following six ways:<ref name=":2" />

{{interlinear|number=SVO|awa•sisak nipahe•wak si•si•pa|children killed ducks|}}
{{interlinear|number=SOV|awa•sisak si•si•pa nipahe•wak|children ducks killed|}}
{{interlinear|number=VSO|nipahe•wak awa•sisak si•si•pa|killed children ducks|}}
{{interlinear|number=VOS|nipahe•wak si•si•pa awa•sisak|killed ducks children|}}
{{interlinear|number=OVS|si•si•pa nipahe•wak awa•sisak|ducks killed children|}}
{{interlinear|number=OSV|si•si•pa awa•sisak nipahe•wak|ducks children killed|}}

Moreover, due to the extensive morphology, subject and object noun phrases can be left out completely:<ref name=":2" />

: ''nipahe•wak''   ('they killed them' - omitting the subject 'children' and object 'ducks' completely)

==== Obviation ====
Cree uses three levels of 'person' categories: first person (the speaker), second person (the addressee), and third (neither speaker nor addressee). However, a characterizing aspect of Cree grammar, is that the third person is divided into third person and third person [[obviative]], used when referring to a person who is not in direct relation to the context, sometimes called the 'fourth person'.<ref name=":2" /> These nouns are generally understood as being in the 'background' of the conversation whereas the proximate nouns in the conversation are the nouns that are immediately in question. [[Obviative|Obviative nouns]] are marked with the suffix ''-a''<ref name=":2" />''.''

===== Negation =====
There are two negative markers in Cree: ''namo•ya'' or ''nama'' and ''e•ka•'' or ''e•ka•ya''<ref name=":2" />''.'' These different negative markers are found in general to coincide with [[Independent clause|main]] and [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]], where ''namo•ya'' is used in main clauses and ''e•ka•'' is used in subordinate clauses. The ''e•ka•ya'' marker is found to be connected with [[Imperative sentence|imperative]] sentences.

====== Questions ======
When asking a yes-no question in Cree, the question marker ''ci•'' is found at the end of the first word of the clause.<ref name=":2" />

For example:
:''kikisiwahitin ci•?'' ('Have I made you angry?)

Indirect yes-no questions use a specific conditional marker equivalent to the English word 'if'. In the Plains Cree dialect (lack of Woods Cree documentation) the conditional marker is ''ki•spin''.

When asking a content question in Cree, the interrogative pronoun is usually found at the start of the sentence.<ref name=":2" />

For example:
:''ta•nite• e•-wi•-itohte•yan?'' ('Where are you going to?)

Indirect content questions will use the same interrogative pronouns.

====== Pronouns ======
The two syntactical pronoun forms are interrogative pronouns and demonstrative pronouns.

Interrogative pronouns are also used in Cree to ask direct questions.<ref name=":1" /> Commonly used are the following: who = ''awína'', what = ''kikway'', when = ''tánispihk'', where = ''tániti'', and why = ''táníhki''<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Our Languages ~ Swampy Cree ~ Basic Morphology and Syntax|url = http://www.sicc.sk.ca/archive/heritage/sils/ourlanguages/swampy/grammar/nouns.html|website = www.sicc.sk.ca|access-date = 2015-10-20}}</ref>''.'' However, these words change form when describing singular versus plural nouns. For example: singular = ''awína'' and ''kikway'' versus plural = ''awíniki'' and ''kikwaya.'' The animacy of the noun also affects the interrogative pronoun creating four different words that are used when asking a question:<ref name=":1" />
{| class="wikitable"
!Animate
!Inanimate
!English
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|
|-
|tániwa
|tániwí
|where is he/she/it?
|-
|tána
|tánima
|which one?
|-
|'''Plural'''
|
|
|-
|tániwíyák
|tániwíhá
|where are they?
|-
|tániki
|tánihi
|which one?
|}
Demonstrative pronouns have two separate forms depending on whether the noun animate or inanimate is:<ref name=":1" />
{| class="wikitable"
!colspan=2|Animate
!colspan=2|Inanimate
|-
!Singular || Plural
!Singular || Plural
|-
|{{interlinear|awa|this}}
|{{interlinear|óki|these}}
|{{interlinear|óma|this}}
|{{interlinear|óhi|these}}
|-
|{{interlinear|ana|that}}
|{{interlinear|aniki|those}}
|{{interlinear|anima|that}}
|{{interlinear|anihi|those}}
|-
|{{interlinear|níhí|that in the distance}}
|{{interlinear|níki|those in the distance}}
|{{interlinear|níma|that in the distance}}
|{{interlinear|níhi|those in the distance}}
|}

In Cree, it is possible to put two demonstrative pronouns together to be very specific about the location of an object.<ref name=":1" /> A third form of demonstrative denotes an (in)animate subject/object that is far in the distance: ''níhí'' (singular animate) ''níki'' (plural animate) and ''níma'' (singular inanimate) ''níhi'' (plural inanimate).

== Vocabulary ==
Due to the polysynthetic nature of the Cree language many words in Cree appear to be very long to other less morphologically expressive languages. For example, in Cree the word tîwâpôhkêwin would be translated in English as 'the making of tea'.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Online Cree Dictionary, Cree Language, Cree: Words, Alberta Elders' Dictionary, Maskwacis|url = http://www.creedictionary.com/|website = www.creedictionary.com|access-date = 2015-11-12}}</ref> Cree vocabulary is then extremely expansive. However, the following terms and phrases give a good impression of the Woods Cree dialectal form of making words:
{| class="wikitable"
!Woods Cree
!English
|-
|tānisi
|Hello
|-
|tānisi ikwa kī'''th'''a
|How are you?
|-
|namwāc nānitaw

|-
|tawāw pihtokī
|Come in(side)
|-
|tīniki
|Thank you
|-
|tānisi kititahkamikisisn
|What are you doing?
|-
|kisāstīw

|-

|-

|He/she is sleeping
|-
|kīwīw
|He/she is going home
|-
|ayamiw
|He/she is talking
|-
|nikamow
|He/she is singing
|-
|mīcisow
|He/she is eating
|}
In the above chart, the bolded letters show the dialect specific ''th-'' (/ð/) sound in Woods Cree. In other dialects of Cree this phoneme would be replaced by a different phoneme (such as /y/ in Plains Cree). The letters with a line above them (ō, ā, ī) represent the long vowels, where as the regular letters (o, a, i) represent the short vowel version.

All above listed vocabulary was found at the following website:

== Writing System ==
The writing system and most effective way of writing of Woods Cree is the [[Cree syllabics|Cree syllabic]] system, created by missionary [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] during the 1830s. The syllabic writing system, however, is slowly being replaced by Roman orthography due to the language being taught in Canadian school systems and especially universities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cree, Woods|url = https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cwd|access-date = 2015-10-05}}</ref>

The basic syllable structure of Woods Cree is (C)(w)V(C)(C) where /h/ will never occur at the beginning or end of syllables and words.

The following examples are of a text called "Encounters with bears" spoken by Mrs. Janet Feitz and transcribed into Woods Cree syllabics as well as the Roman orthography:<ref>{{Cite web|title = ᓀᐦᐃᖬᐍᐏᐣ Woods Cree Text|url = http://www.languagegeek.com/algon/cree/thcr_example.html|website = www.languagegeek.com|access-date = 2015-11-10}}</ref>
