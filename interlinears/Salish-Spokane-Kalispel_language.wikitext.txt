The '''Salish''' or '''Séliš language''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|l|ɪ|ʃ}}, also known as '''Kalispel–Pend d'oreille''', '''Kalispel–Spokane–Flathead''', or, to distinguish it from the [[Salishan languages|Salish language family]] to which it gave its name, '''Montana Salish''', is a Salishan language spoken (as of 2005) by about 64 elders of the [[Flathead Nation]] in north central [[Montana]] and of the [[Kalispel Indian Reservation]] in northeastern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], and by another 50 elders (as of 2000) of the [[Spokane Indian Reservation]] of Washington. As of 2012, Salish is "critically endangered" in Montana and Idaho according to UNESCO.<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref>

Dialects are spoken by the [[Spokane tribe|Spokane]] (Npoqínišcn), [[Kalispel tribe|Kalispel]] (Qalispé), [[Pend d'Oreilles tribe|Pend d'Oreilles]], and [[Bitterroot Salish tribe|Bitterroot Salish]] (Séliš). The total ethnic population was 8,000 in 1977, but most have switched to English.

As with many other languages of northern North America, Salish is [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]; like other languages of the [[Mosan languages|Mosan]] [[language area]], there is no clear distinction between nouns and verbs. Salish is famous{{according to whom|date=November 2017}} for native translations that treat all lexical Salish words as verbs or clauses in English—for instance, translating a two-word Salish clause that would appear to mean "I-killed a-deer" into English as ''I killed it. It was a deer.''

==Phonology==
===Salish===
====Vowels====
Salish has five vowels, {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}, plus an [[epenthetic]] [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} which occurs between an [[obstruent consonant|obstruent]] and a [[sonorant consonant]], or between two unlike sonorants. (Differences in glottalization do not cause epenthesis, and in long sequences not all pairs are separated, for example in {{IPA|/sqllú/}} → {{IPA|[sqəllú]}} "tale", {{IPA|/ʔlˀlát͡s/}} → {{IPA|[ʔəlˀlát͡s]}} "red raspberry", and {{IPA|/sˀnmˀné/}} → {{IPA|[səʔnəmˀné]}} "toilet". No word may begin with a vowel.

====Consonants====
Salish has [[pharyngeal consonant]]s, which are rare worldwide and uncommon but not unusual in the [[Mosan languages|Mosan]] [[language area|''Sprachbund'']] to which Salish belongs. It is also unusual in lacking a simple [[lateral approximant]] and simple [[velar consonant]]s ({{IPA|/k/}} only occurs in [[loanword]]s), though again this is known elsewhere in the Mosan area.

The post-velars are normally transcribed as [[uvular consonant]]s: {{angbr IPA|q, qʼ, χ, qʷ, qʷʼ, χʷ}}.

Salish contrasts [[affricate]]s with [[stop consonant|stop]]–[[fricative]] sequences. For example, {{IPA-sal|ʔiɬt͡ʃt͡ʃeˀn|}} "tender, sore" has a sequence of two affricates, whereas {{IPA-sal|stiʕít.ʃən|}} "killdeer" has a tee-esh sequence. All stop consonants are clearly released, even in clusters or word-finally. Though they are generally not aspirated, aspiration often occurs before obstruents and [[epenthetic]] [[schwa]]s before sonorants. For example, the word {{IPA|/t͡ʃɬkʷkʷtˀnéˀws/}} "a fat little belly" is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡ʃɬkꭩkꭩtʰəʔnéʔʍs]}}; likewise, {{IPA|/t͡ʃt͡ʃt͡sʼéˀlʃt͡ʃn/}} "woodtick" is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡ʃt͡ʃt͡sʼéʔt͡ɬʃᵗʃən]}}, and {{IPA|/ppíˀl/}} is {{IPA|[pʰpíḭᵗɬə̥]}}.

===Spokane===

====Vowels====
Spokane vowels show five contrasts: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/, but almost all examples of /a/ and /o/ are lowered from /e/ and /u/, respectively, when those precede uvulars, or precede or follow pharyngeals. Unstressed vowels are inserted to break up certain consonant clusters, with the vowel quality determined by the adjacent consonants. The epenthetic vowel is often realized as /ə/, but also /ɔ/ before rounded uvulars, and /ɪ/ before alveolars and palatals.<ref name="Esling 97–102">{{Cite journal|last=Esling|first=John H.|last2=Carlson|first2=Barry F.|date=December 2000|title=Spokane|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=97–102|doi=10.1017/S0025100300006708|issn=1475-3502}}</ref>

====Consonants====
The consonant inventory of Spokane differs from Salish somewhat, including plain and glottalized central alveolar approximants {{IPA|/ɹ/}} and {{IPA|/ˀɹ/}}, and a uvular series instead of post-velar.<ref name="Esling 97–102"/>

====Stress====

Spokane words are [[polysynthetic]], typically based on roots with CVC(C) structure, plus many [[affix]]es. There is one main stress in each word, though the location of stress is determined in a complex way (Black 1996).<ref name="Esling 97–102"/><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The morphological and phonological structures of Spokane lexemes|url=https://dspace.library.uvic.ca//handle/1828/9805|date=1996|degree=PhD|first=Deirdre Jean|last=Black|publisher=University of Victoria}}</ref>

==Morphology==
<section begin="list-of-glossing-abbreviations"/><div style="display:none;">
OC:out-of-control morpheme reduplication
SUCCESS:success aspect morpheme
</div><section end="list-of-glossing-abbreviations"/>

Given its [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] nature, Salish-Spokane-Kalispel encodes meaning in single morphemes rather than lexical items. In the Spokane dialect specifically, the morphemes ¬–nt and –el', denote transitivity and intransitivity, respectively. Meaning, they show whether or not a verb takes a direct object or it does not. For example, in (1) and (2), the single morphemes illustrate these properties rather than it being encoded in the verb as it is in English.

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|top= ɫx̥ʷntén
|ɫox̩ʷ -nt -en
|open(ed) -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I made a hole in it'}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|top= pllstél
|puls -VC -st -el'
|{die, kill} -OC -TR -SUCCESS
|'He got to kill (one)'}}

Something that is unique to the Spokane dialect is the SUCCESS aspect morpheme: -nu.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Barry|title=Situation aspect and a Spokane control morpheme.|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=1996|volume=62|pages=59–69|doi=10.1086/466275}}</ref> The SUCCESS marker allows the denotation that the act took more effort than it normally would otherwise. In (3) and (4) we can see this particular transformation.

{{interlinear|number=(3)
|top= ɫp'ntén
|ɫip' -nt -en
|mark -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I marked it'}}

{{interlinear|number=(4)
|top= ɫp'nún
|ɫip' -nu -nt- en
|mark -SUCCESS -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I had a hard time marking it'}}

The SUCCESS aspect and an OUT-OF-CONTROL morpheme reduplication, found in other Native languages, are commonly found together in Spokane Salish. An OUT-OF-CONTROL reduplication morpheme denotes that the action was done by accident. Below, (5), (6) and (7) exemplify this.

{{interlinear|number=(5)
|top= ɫuʔntén
|ɫuʔ -nt -en
|stab -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I stabbed it/him/her.'}}

{{interlinear|number=(6)
|top= ɫuʔnún
|ɫuʔ -nu -nt -en
|stab -SUCCESS -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I managed to stab it/him/her.'}}

{{interlinear|number=(7)
|top= tuʔʔnún
|tuʔ -VC -nu -nt -en
|stab -OC -SUCCESS -TR -1sg.SUBJ
|'I managed to stab it/him/her by accident.'}}

The intransitive morpheme that describes extra effort is –el'. Barry Carlson states that:

"Spokane intransitive success forms, created with -el', emphasize that a subject's control requires extra effort in an event and they focus the duration of this effort well before the event beginning. This makes the predication a result. Thus, their true meaning can only be seen in a larger context."

That is to say, that for intransitive instances it is context driven and therefore extra context is needed in order to use the morpheme –el'. Example (8) derived from (1) illustrates this:

{{interlinear|number=(8)
|top= pllstél'
|puls -VC -st -el'
|{die, kill} -OC -TR -SUCCESS
|'He got to kill (one)'}}

{{interlinear|number=(9)
|šíč'l' u ʔax̩í u pllstél'
|{he missed} and finally and {he got to kill (one)}
|'He kept missing, but finally he got to kill (one)'}}
