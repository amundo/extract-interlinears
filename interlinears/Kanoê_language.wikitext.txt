'''Kanoê''' or '''Kapishana''' is a nearly [[language death|extinct]] [[language isolate]] of [[Rondônia]], [[Brazil]]. The Kapishana people now speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or other indigenous languages from intermarriage.

The language names are also spelled ''Kapixana, Kapixanã,'' and ''Canoé'', the last shared with [[Ava-Canoeiro language|Awa-Canoeiro]].

The Kanoê people, although disperse in the southeastern part of the state of Rondônia, live mainly along the Guaropé River. The language is nearly extinct, with only 5 speakers in a population of about 319 Kanoê people.<ref name="2pib">{{cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/pt/povo/kanoe|title=Povo|author=Laércio Nora Bacelar|website=Povos Indígenas No Brasil|publisher=Instituto Socioambiental}}</ref>

==Classification==
Although Kanoê is generally considered to be a [[language isolate]], there have been various proposals linking it with other languages and language families.<ref name="Campbell-SAmerica">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |editor1-last=Grondona |editor1-first=Verónica |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Lyle |date=2012 |title=The Indigenous Languages of South America |chapter=Classification of the indigenous languages of South America |series=The World of Linguistics |volume=2 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=59-166 |isbn=978-3-11-025513-3}}</ref>

Van der Voort (2005) observes similarities among Kanoê, [[Kwaza language|Kwaza]], and [[Aikanã language|Aikanã]], but believes the evidence is not strong enough to definitively link the three languages together as part of a single language family.<ref>Van der Voort, Hein. 2005. Kwaza in a comparative perspective. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 71: 365–412.</ref>

Price (1978) proposes a relationship with the [[Nambikwaran languages]],<ref>Price, David P. 1978. The Nambiquara linguistic family. ''Anthropological Linguistics'' 20 (1): 14–37.</ref> while Kaufman (1994, 2007) suggests that [[Kunza language|Kunza]] is related.<ref>Kaufman, Terrence. 1994. The native languages of South America.

==Language contact==
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with [[Kwaza language|Kwaza]], [[Aikanã language|Aikanã]], and the [[Nambikwaran languages]] due to contact.<ref name="Jolkesky-2016">{{cite thesis|last=Jolkesky |first=Marcelo Pinho de Valhery |date=2016 |url=http://www.etnolinguistica.org/tese:jolkesky-2016-arqueoecolinguistica |title=Estudo arqueo-ecolinguístico das terras tropicais sul-americanas |type=Ph.D. dissertation |location=Brasília |publisher=University of Brasília |edition=2}}</ref>

==History==

The first contact of the Kanoé people with the "white man" brought a lot of death through sickness. Many of the people died of [[pertussis]], [[measles]], and stomach problems since they did not have the medicine needed to fight the diseases that were available to the "white man". There was also a lot of death due to conflicts with the farmers in the area.<ref name="2pib"/>

The Kanoê people can be found in two main areas, the banks of the [[Guaporé River]] and the [[Rio Omerê Indigenous Territory|Omorê River]]. The main population, living by Guaporé River, share the land with other indigenous people and a long history of cohabitation with the "white man".  Most of them are inserted into the Brazilian society and married to people belonging to other indigenous groups. Only three of them still speak the Kanoê language today.

By the Omerê River, a single family of Kanoê can be found, with much less influence from the Brazilian society. Having fled into a forest reserve, this group is considered isolated indigenous people, only allowing outside contact in 1995 after many years of attempts by the Ethno Environmental Protection Front. As of 2003, only four people remained of this Kanoê family, with two of them being monolingual Kanoê speakers. The area by the [[Rio Omerê Indigenous Territory|Omerê River]] is believed to be the original territory of the Kanoê people by Victor Dequech (1942) and Etta Becker-Donner (1955).

==Current status==

For a long time Kanoê was too poorly attested to classify. Various proposals were advanced on little evidence; Price (1978) for example thought Kanoê might be one of the [[Nambikwaran languages]]. When it was finally described in some detail, by Bacelar (2004), it turned out to be a language isolate. It is believed to have been a naturally developed language, adapted to the needs of the Kanoê people.<ref name="1prodoclin">{{cite web|url=http://prodoclin.museudoindio.gov.br/index.php/etnias/kanoe|title= Kanoê|website=Projeto de Documentação de Línguas Indígenas|publisher=Museu do Indio}}</ref>

The first written study of the Kanoê language available today, dates back to 1943 when Stanislav Zach published a vocabulary of the Kanoê tribe,<ref name="3Zach">{{cite book |last=Stanislav |first=Zach |year=1943 |title=Vocabulário das tribos Massacá, Salamãi, Coiá e Canoê.|location=Rio de Janeiro |language=pt}}</ref> which was later updated in 1963 by [[Cestmír Loukotka]].

A preliminary report of the phonological features of the Kanoê language was published by Laércio Bacelar in 1992,<ref name="bacelar-fono">{{cite book |last=Bacelar |first=Laércio |year=1992 |title=Fonologia preliminar da língua Kanoê. |location=Brasília |publisher=Universidade de Brasília|language=pt}}</ref> with a second report and an analysis of the phonology published in 1994.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bacelar|first1=Laércio|title=Fonologia segmental da língua Kanoê: uma análise preliminar|journal=Signótica: Revista do Mestrado em Letras e Linguística|date=1994|issue=6|pages=59–72|publisher=UFGO|location=Goiânia|language=pt}}</ref> Bacelar and Cleiton Pereira wrote a paper on the morphosyntax of the language in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bacelar|first1=Laércio|last2=Pereira|first2=Cleiton|title=Aspectos Morfossintáticos da Língua Kanoê.|journal=Signótica: Revista do Mestrado em Letras e Linguística|date=1996|issue=8|pages=45–55|publisher=UFGO|location=Goiânia|language=pt}}</ref> And in 1998 a paper on the negation and litotes of the language was published by Bacelar and Augusto Silva Júnior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bacelar|first1=Laércio|last2=Silva Júnior|first2=Augusto|title=A negação e a litotes na língua Kanoê|journal=Signótica: Revista do Mestrado em Letras e Linguística|date=1998|issue=9|publisher=UFGO|location=Goiânia|language=pt}}</ref> Since then, Laércio Bacelar has been the main linguist investigating the language and working alongside the Kanoê people. In 2004 he published a detailed description of its phonology, grammar and syntax.<ref name="4bacelar" />

A project called [http://prodoclin.museudoindio.gov.br/index.php/etnias/kanoe/projeto ''Etnografia e Documentação da Lingua Kanoé''] is underway with a lexicographic and ethnographic approach to record auditory and written data of the Kanoê language. The project is currently coordinated by Laércio Nora Bacelar, a Brazilian linguist, and is funded by [[Museu do Índio|FUNAI - Museu do Índio]] and by [[UNESCO]]. The project also has the support of the entire Kanoê community from both the Guaropé and the Omorê rivers.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

![[Flap consonant|Flap]]
|  ||{{IPA link|ɾ}}||  ||
|}
{{IPA|/x/}} is limited to a few verb forms, ‿where it occurs before {{IPA|/ĩ/}}. {{IPA|/ts/}} is highly variable, {{IPA|[ts tʃ s ʃ]}}, with the affricates being the more common, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} rare, and {{IPA|[tʃ ʃ]}} most common before {{IPA|/i u/}}. {{IPA|/r/}} is {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, {{IPA|[d]}} after {{IPA|[n]}} and occasionally initially. {{IPA|/ɲ/}} varies as {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}}. {{IPA|/n/}} is {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/k/}}, a pattern which occurs during metathesis. {{IPA|/p/}} is very rarely realized as {{IPA|[ɓ]}}. {{IPA|/w/ /j/}} are nasalized after nasal vowels.

===Vowels===

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|i||ĩ||ɨ||ɨ̃||u||ũ
|-
|e||ẽ|| || ||o||õ
|-
|æ||æ̃||a||ʌ̃|| ||
|}
Vowel qualities are {{IPA|/i ɛ æ ɨ a u ɔ/}}, all oral and nasal; the nasal vowels have slightly different or variable pronunciations: {{IPA|[ĩ], [ɛ̃]~[ẽ], [æ̃], [ɨ̃], [ã]~[ʌ̃], [ɔ̃]~[õ], [ũ]}}.

Oral vowels are optionally nasalized next to nasal stops, with the variation of phonemically nasal vowels. {{IPA|/ɛ/}} varies as {{IPA|[ɛ]~[e]}} after {{IPA|/ts/}} and next to an approximant. {{IPA|/ɨ/}} varies as {{IPA|[ɨ]~[ə]}} after voiceless consonants. {{IPA|/ɔ/}} varies as {{IPA|[ɔ]~[o]}} after {{IPA|/p, m/}}. Vowels may have a voiceless offglide (effectively {{IPA|[h]}}) when not followed by a voiced sound.

Vowels are long when they constitute a morpheme of their own. Stress is on the last syllable of a word. Maximally complex syllable is CGVG, where G is a glide {{IPA|/j w/}}, or, due to epenthesis in certain morphological situations or to elision, the final consonant may be {{IPA|/m n/}}. One of the more syllabically complex words is {{IPA|/kwivɛjkaw/}} 'to shave'. Vowel sequences occur, as in {{IPA|/eaere/}} 'chief'.

==Morphology==

Kanoê is a [[polysynthetic language]], where the more complex words are the verbs (Payne 1997). It is also primarily an [[agglutinative language]], and many words are formed by simple roots, juxtaposition and suffixation.<ref name="1prodoclin"/> The gender can be expressed by suffixation or by a hyperonym, and while Kanoê does not make a distinction of number, it does make a distinction between uncountable and countable nouns, where the suffix {-te} is added<ref name="4bacelar">{{Cite book |url=http://webdoc.ubn.kun.nl/mono/b/bacelar_l/gramdalik.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140728032518/http://webdoc.ubn.kun.nl/mono/b/bacelar_l/gramdalik.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-28 |title=Gramática da língua Kanoê |last=Bacelar |first=Laércio Nora |publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen |year=2004 |location=Nijmegen |language=pt |hdl=2066/19429 |hdl-access=free |access-date=2011-04-19 }}</ref>
. The syntax order of Kanoê follows SOV = subject + object + verb.<ref name="1prodoclin"/>

In the Kanoê language, the process of morphological reduplication is used to form [[frequentative]] verbs.  For example, manamana 'kneading', or mañumañu 'chewing'. Although some names show reduplication, it can have an [[onomatopoeic]] motivation instead of a morphologic one - most names with reduplication are names for animals and birds, in which the phonetic sequence of the reduplication do seem to imitate the sounds characteristic of said animals, for example kurakura 'chicken' or tsõjtsõj 'colibri bird'.<ref name="4bacelar" />

===Pronouns===

====Personal pronouns====

[[Personal pronouns]] in the Kanoê language follow a monomorphic free form in the singular and bimorphic in the plural. These pronouns can occur in the subject or object position. The formation of the plural pronouns follow the formula PRO.PL → PRO.SG + COL, where PRO is the singular form of the pronoun and  -COL is the plural morpheme ''{-te}''.<ref name="4bacelar" />

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

|-
! [[Grammatical person|2nd person]]
| ''mi'' || ''mite''
|-
! [[Grammatical person|3rd person]]
| ''oj'' || ''ojte''
|}

For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|aj {ore õ-ry} e-re
|1SG tire-1-REFL DECL-AUX
|"I am tired."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ajte {ore õ-ry} e-re
|1PL tire-1-REFL DECL-AUX
|"We are tired."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|aj mi vara-õ-ro-pe-to õ-ke-re
|1SG 2SG speak-1-CLV-2-TR 1-NEG-DECL-AUX
|"I don't speak with you."}}

====Possessive pronouns====

The form for possessive pronouns are monomorphic in the POSS.1SG ''ña'' and POSS.2SG ''pjs'' but bimorphic for POSS.3SG ''oho'' which is formed by 3SG ''oj'' plus the possessive ''{-o}''. The plural form for the possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix ''{-to}'' which in itself is the result of the suffixes ''{-te}'' plus ''{-o}''.<ref name="4bacelar" />

|''pja'' || yours||''pjato''||yours
|-

For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ña i-kɨ̃j vaj-õ-kɨ̃j e-re
|POSS.1SG RN-eye sting-1-eye DECL-AUX
|"My eye stings."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|pjato kan-te iriri-ø-ro n-e-re
|POSS.2PL child-COL run-2-CLV 3-DECL-AUX
|"Your children are running."}}

====Demonstrative pronouns====

There are only two demonstrative pronouns in the Kanoê language, ''jũ'', "this" for objects in close proximity and ''ũko'', "that" for objects at a distance. The demonstrative pronouns do not make a distinction between number or gender.

For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|jũ ævo ereã k-e-re
|DEM.prox man big NEG-DECL-AUX
|"This man is short ({{lit}} This man is not tall)."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|mi ũko itevæ pi-patenũ-ø-to k-e-re
|2SG DEM.dist people 2-know-3-TR NEG-DECL-AUX
|"You don't know that man."}}

====Indefinite pronouns====

There are a total of four indefinite pronouns, which are used based on the object. The {{lang|kxo|nuvi}} and {{lang|kxo|tsyke}} pronouns can be used with the gender suffix ''{-kɨ̃j}'' for masculine and ''{-nake}'' for feminine.

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! colspan="2" |For humans
! colspan="2" |For non-humans
|-
|{{lang|kxo|nuvi}} || who/someone||{{lang|kxo|naj}}||something
|-
|{{lang|kxo|tsyke}} || someone else||{{lang|kxo|tsake}}||something else
|-
|}

For Example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|tsyke -kɨ̃j tũ-o e-re
|Someone else-M die-INTR DECL-AUX
|"Someone else died."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|oj naj topi-e u-ro e-re
|3SG something rotten-NMLZ eat-CLV DECL-AUX
|"He ate something bad."}}

==Syntax==

The Kanoê language is a [[nominative-accusative language]], given that the subjects of both [[transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] and [[intransitive]] verbal actions are marked the same way, while the object is marked differently. For subjects of either intransitive or transitive verbal actions, the suffix ''{-ro}'' 'CLV' is added to the verb, and for direct objects of transitive sentences, the suffix ''{-to}'' 'TR' is added to the verb.<ref name="4bacelar" />

For example:

{{interlinear|number=a.
|kani iriri-ø'''-ro''' e-re
|child run-3-CLV DECL-AUX
|"The child ran."}}

{{interlinear|number=b.
|pja e ña kani vara-ø'''-ro'''-ø'''-to''' n-e-re
|POSS.2SG woman POSS.1SG child speak-3-CLV-3-TR 3-DECL-AUX
|"Your woman is speaking with my child."}}

In example ''a.'' it can be seen that the intransitive verb ''{iriri-}'' "run" takes one subject'' kani'' "child", and the morpheme ''{-ro}'' which attaches the subject as the agent of the verbal action. In example ''b.'' the transitive verb ''{vara-}'' "speak" takes a subject, ''pja e'' "your woman", which the morpheme ''{-ro}'' attaches as the subject of the verbal action; and an object, ''ña kani'' "my child", which the morpheme ''{-to}'' attaches as the object of the verbal action. Examples ''a.'' and ''b.'' show that the morphemes for subjects of transitive or intransitive verbal actions are the same.

{{interlinear|number=c.
|jato atiti epæ'''-ro''' n-e-re
|POSS.1PL corn born-3-CLV 3-DECL-AUX
|{{lit}} "Our corn is being born."}}

{{interlinear|number=d.
|ævo atiti paj-ø'''-ro''' e-re
|man corn break-3-TR DECL-AUX
|"The man harvested the corn." ({{lit}} "The man broke the corn")}}

Comparing examples ''c.'' and ''d.'' it can be seen that the morpheme ''{-ro}'' is used when ''atiti'' "corn" is the subject of the verbal action, and ''{-to}'' is used when ''atiti'' "corn" is the object of the verbal action. It shows that morphemes for subjects and objects of verbal actions are different.

==Semantics==

A field study by Bacelar (2004), shows that there are no inflections for number in the language. even though the Kanoê language uses the pluralizer ''{-te}'' to interpret nouns as a collective derived by the suffixation. Mass nouns cannot be pluralized.

|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''kwini ''||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''kwini-te''
|-
| ||fish|| ||school of fish
|}

===Quantifier===

The most used method to express quantity in the Kanoê language is the anteposition of the quantifier ''arakere'' "many". It is presumed that the quantifier arakere is formed by a [[litotes]] mechanism and that its internal structure follows ''{ara-}'' "few" + ''{-k}'' 'NEG' + ''{-e}'' 'DECL' + ''{-re}'' 'AUX'.<ref name="4bacelar" />

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''kani ''||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''arakere kani''
|-
| ||child|| ||many children
|}

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''mapi ''||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''arakere mapi''
|-
| ||arrow|| ||many arrows
|}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|aj {ara k-e-re} kani õ-tsi mo-e-re
|1SG few-NEG-DECL-AUX child 1-have APL-DECL-AUX
|"I have many children."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|oj tu-kwæ̃ ara-tũ-kwæ̃ k-e-re
|3PL brother-MASC few-brother-MASC NEG-DECL-AUX
|"He has many brothers." ({{lit}} "He has not few brothers")}}

The quantifier arakere can also be used together with numerals to change its meaning to "few":

{{interlinear|indent=3
|mini aj [mow-mow {ara k-e} mapi] õ-tsi mo-e-re
|today 1SG two-two few-NEG-NMZ arrow 1-have APL-DECL-AUX
|"Today I have only four arrows."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|aj re õ-e-re [pja {ara k-e} uromu]
|1SG kill 1-DECL-AUX one few-NEG-NMZ alligator
|"I killed only one alligator."}}

The Kanoê language also has an interrogative quantifier ''nẽtoe'' "how many" which is used at the beginning of the sentence:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|nẽtoe kani tuvo ni-tsi
|{how many} child sick 3-INT
|"How many children are sick?"}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|nẽtoe kani mi pe-tsi mi-tsi
|{how many} child 2SG 2-have 2-INT
|"How many children do you have?"}}
