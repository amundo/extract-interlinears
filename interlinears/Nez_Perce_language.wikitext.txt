'''Nez Perce''', also spelled '''Nez Percé''' or called '''Nimipuutímt''' (alternatively spelled ''Nimiipuutímt'', ''Niimiipuutímt'', or ''Niimi'ipuutímt''), is a [[Sahaptian languages|Sahaptian]] language related to the several dialects of [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]] (note the spellings ''-ian'' vs. ''-in''). Nez Perce comes from the French phrase ''nez percé'', "pierced nose"; however, Nez Perce, who call themselves ''Nimiipuu'', meaning "the people", did not pierce their noses.<ref name=fun>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/nez_kids.htm|title=Facts for Kids: Nez Perce Indians (Nez Perces)|website=www.bigorrin.org|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref> This [[misnomer]] may have occurred as a result of confusion on the part of the French, as it was surrounding tribes who did so.<ref name=fun/>

The Sahaptian sub-family is one of the branches of the [[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian family]] (which, in turn, may be related to a larger [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] grouping). It is spoken by the [[Nez Perce people]] of the [[Northwestern United States]].

Nez Perce is a highly [[endangered language]]. While sources differ on the exact number of fluent speakers, it is almost definitely under 100. The Nez Perce tribe is endeavoring to reintroduce the language into native usage through a [[language revitalization]] program, but (as of 2015) the future of the Nez Perce language is far from assured.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Nimi'ipuu Language Teaching and Family Learning| work = NILI Projects| access-date = 2017-08-10| url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/nwili/projects}}</ref>

==Phonology==
The [[phonology]] of Nez Perce includes [[vowel harmony]] (which was mentioned in [[Noam Chomsky]] & [[Morris Halle]]'s ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]''), as well as a complex [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] system described by Crook (1999).

=== Vowels ===
Nez Perce has an average-sized inventory of five vowels, each marked for [[Vowel length|length]]. Unusually for a five-vowel system, however, it lacks a [[Mid front unrounded vowel|mid front vowel]] /{{IPA|e}}/, with low front /{{IPA|æ}}/ in its place. Such an asymmetrical configuration is found in less than five percent of the languages that distinguish exactly five vowels, and among those that do display an asymmetry, the "missing" vowel is overwhelmingly more likely to be a back vowel /{{IPA|u}}/ or /{{IPA|o}}/ than front /{{IPA|e}}/. Indeed, Nez Perce's lack of a mid front vowel within a five-vowel system appears unique, and contrary to basic tendencies toward triangularity in the allocation of vowel space. A potential reason for this peculiarity is discussed in the section on vowel harmony below.

Stress is marked with an acute accent (á, é, í, ó, ú).

==== Diphthongs ====
Nez Perce distinguishes seven [[Diphthong|diphthongs]], all with phonemic length:
{| class="wikitable"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]

! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align="center"

| {{IPA|au̯}} {{IPA|aːu̯}} {{IPA|ai̯}} {{IPA|aːi̯}}
|
|}

==== Vowel harmony ====
Nez Perce displays an extensive system of [[vowel harmony]]. Vowel qualities are divided into two opposing sets, "dominant" /{{IPA|i a o}}/ and "recessive" /{{IPA|i æ u}}/. The presence of a dominant vowel causes all recessive vowels within the same phonological word to assimilate to their dominant counterpart; hence /{{IPA|cǽːqæt}}/ {{Lang|nez|cé·qet}} "raspberry" becomes /{{IPA|cáːqat'ajn}}/ {{Lang|nez|cá·qat'ayn}} "for a raspberry" with the addition of the dominant-marked suffix /-{{IPA|ʔajn}}/.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aoki|first=Haruo|date=December 1966|title=Nez Perce Vowel Harmony and Proto-Sahaptian Vowels|journal=Language|volume=42|pages=759-767}}</ref> With very few exceptions, therefore, phonological words may contain only vowels of the dominant or recessive set. Despite occurring in both sets, /i/ is not neutral; instead, it is either dominant or recessive depending on the morpheme in which it occurs.

This system presents a challenge to common concepts of vowel harmony, since it does not appear to be based on obvious considerations of backness, height, or [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue root position]]. To account for this, Katherine Nelson (2013) proposes that the two sets be considered as distinct "triangles" of vowel space, each by themselves maximally dispersed, where the recessive set is somewhat retracted (further back) in comparison to the dominant:
{| class="wikitable"
!Recessive → dominant
! Front
!  Central
! Back
|- align="center"
! High
| {{IPA|i}} (→ i)
|
| rowspan="2" | {{IPA|u}} → o
|- align="center"
! Low
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|æ}} → a
|}
This dual system would simultaneously explain two apparent phonological aberrances: the absence of a mid front vowel /{{IPA|e}}/, and the fact that phonemic /i/ can be marked either as dominant or recessive. Since the three vowels of a given set are placed with regard to the other vowels ''of the same set'', the low height of the front vowel /{{IPA|æ}}/ appears natural (that is, maximally dispersed) against its high counterparts /{{IPA|i u}}/, as in a three-vowel system such as those of [[Arabic phonology|Arabic]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]. The high front vowel /{{IPA|i}}/ meanwhile, is retracted much less in the transition from recessive to dominant - little enough that the distinction does not surface phonemically - and therefore can be placed near to the crux around which the triangle of vowel space is "tilted" by retraction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Katherine|date=June 2013|title=The Nez Perce vowel system: A phonetic analysis|url=https://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/1.4800241|journal=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|volume=19}}</ref>

==Writing system==

==Grammar==
[[Image:Nez-perce-chiefs-1899-camas-prairie.jpg|right|thumb|Nez Perce chiefs]]

As in many other [[indigenous languages of the Americas]], a Nez Perce verb can have the meaning of an entire sentence in English. This manner of providing a great deal of information in one [[Word (linguistics)|word]] is called [[polysynthetic language|polysynthesis]]. Verbal affixes provide information about the [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]], as well as [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (e.g. whether or not an action has been completed).

===History===
[[Asa Bowen Smith]] developed the Nez Perce grammar by adapting the missionary alphabet used in Hawaiian missions, and adding the consonants s and t.<ref name="NPS">{{Cite web |title=Nez Perce National Historical Park |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/nepe/people.html |access-date=2021-11-04 |website=National Park Service}}</ref> In 1840, [[Asa Bowen Smith]] wrote the manuscript for the book ''Grammar of the Language of the Nez Perces Indians Formerly of Oregon, U.S.''.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Asa Bowen |last2=Tingley |first2=Sylvanus |date=1840 |title=Grammar of the Language of the Nez Perces Indians Formerly of Oregon, U.S.: From the manuscript of Rev. A.B. Smith dated Sept. 28, 1840. Now in archives of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Boston, Mass. Volume 138. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/grammar-of-the-language-of-the-nez-perces-indians-formerly-of-oregon-us-from-the-manuscript-of-rev-ab-smith-dated-sept-28-1840-now-in-archives-of-the-american-board-of-commissioners-for-foreign-missions-boston-mass-volume-138-1840-september-28/oclc/39088111 |access-date=2021-11-04 |website=WorldCat |oclc=39088111}}</ref> The [[grammar]] of Nez Perce has been described in a grammar {{harv|Aoki|1973}} and a dictionary {{harv|Aoki|1994}} with two dissertations (Rude 1985; Crook 1999).

===Case===
In Nez Perce, the subject of a sentence, and the object when there is one, can each be marked for [[grammatical case]], an affix that shows the function of the word (compare to English ''he'' vs. ''him'' vs. ''his'').  Nez Perce employs a three-way case-marking strategy: a transitive subject, a transitive object, and an intransitive subject are each marked differently. Nez Perce is thus an example of the very rare type of [[tripartite language]]s (see [[morphosyntactic alignment]]).

Because of this case marking, the word order can be quite free. A specific word order tells the hearer what is new information (''focus'') versus old information (''[[topic (linguistics)|topic]]''), but it does not mark the subject and the object (in English, word order is fixed &mdash; [[subject–verb–object]]).

Nouns in Nez Perce are marked based on how they relate to the transitivity of the verb. Subjects in a sentence with a transitive verb take the ergative suffix ''-nim'', objects in a sentence with a transitive verb take the accusative suffix ''-ne'', and subjects in sentences with an intransitive verb don’t take a suffix.

{| class="wikitable"
! Ergative
! Accusative
! Intransitive subject
|-
| suffix -nim
| suffix -ne<br />(here subject to vowel harmony, resulting in surface form -na)
|

|‘All people respect Grizzly’}}
| {{interlinear
|ᶍáᶍaac  hiwéhyem
|grizzly has.come
|‘Grizzly has come’ (Mithun 1999)}}
|}

This system of marking allows for flexible word order in Nez Perce:

'''Verb–subject–object word order'''
{{interlinear|abbreviations=CSL:cislocative|indent=3
|kii  pée-ten’we-m-e    qíiw-ne ’iceyéeye-nm

|Kaa háatya-nm páa-’nahna-m-a      ’iceyéeye-ne
|and wind-ERG  3→3-carry-CSL-PAST  coyote-OBJ
|‘And the wind carried coyote here’}}

'''Subject–object–verb word order''' 
{{interlinear|indent=3
|Kawó’ kii    háama-pim    ’áayato-na   pée-’nehnen-e
|then  this   husband-ERG  woman-OBJ    3→3-take.away-PAST
