'''Nafaanra''' (sometimes written Nafaara, pronounced {{IPA-xx|nafãːra|}}) is a [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] language spoken in northwest [[Ghana]], along the border with [[Ivory Coast]], east of [[Bondoukou]]. It is spoken by approximately 61,000 people.<ref name="gordon">Ghana Institute for Linguistics, Literacy, and Bible Translation (GILLBT) 2003, as cited in Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nfr Nafaanra: a language of Ghana.] Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Retrieved on 2007-04-10</ref> Its speakers call themselves [[Nafana people|Nafana]], but others call them Banda or Mfantera. Like other Senufo languages, Nafaanra is a [[tone language|tonal]] language. It is somewhat of an outlier in the Senufo language group, with the geographically-closest relatives, the Southern Senufo [[Tagwana–Djimini languages]], approximately {{convert|200|km}} to the west, on the other side of [[Comoé National Park]].

The basic [[word order]] is [[subject–object–verb]], like [[Latin grammar|Latin]] and [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]]. Like other [[Niger–Congo languages]], it has a [[noun class]] system, with [[noun]]s classified according to five different classes, which also affects [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[copula (linguistics)|copulas]]. The [[phonology]] features a distinction between the length of vowels and whether they are [[oral vowel|oral]] or [[nasal vowel|nasal]] (as in [[French phonology|French]] or [[Portuguese phonology|Portuguese]]). There are also three distinct [[tonal language|tones]], a feature shared with the other Senufo languages. Nafaanra grammar features both [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] which are marked with [[grammatical particle|particles]]. Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10, 20 and 100.

==Geography and demography==
Nafaanra is bordered by [[Kulango languages]] to the west, while [[Deg (language)|Deg]] (a [[Gur languages|Gur language]]) and [[Gonja language|Gonja]] ([[Kwa languages|Kwa]]) are found to the north and east. The closest eastern neighbour is the [[Mande languages|Mande language]] [[Ligbi language|Ligbi]], whose speakers are also called ''Banda'') which, like Nafaanra, is an outlier to its own family. Southeast and south of Nafaanra and Ligbi, the [[Akan language]] [[Abron language|Abron]] (also Bron or Brong) is spoken.

The [[Nafana people]] live in the north-west corner of the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]] of Ghana, concentrated mainly in [[Sampa, Ghana|Sampa]] (capital of the Jaman North district) and [[Banda, Ghana|Banda]]. There are two dialectal variants of Nafaanra: Pantera of Banda, and Fantera of Sampa.<ref name="Jordan1980-1">Jordan 1980:1</ref> Bendor-Samuel gives a 79% [[cognate]] relationship on the [[Swadesh list]] between the two dialects, meaning that they have many basic words in common.<ref name="BS">Bendor-Samuel 1971</ref> The Banda dialect is considered central. The terms "Fantera" and "Pantera" come from other peoples and are considered pejorative by the Nafana.<ref name= "Jordan1980-1"/>

The Nafana people say that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says that some of their people are still there, and if they go back they will not be allowed to leave again.<ref>Jordan 1978:84n1</ref> They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from [[Begho]] (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.<ref>Stahl 2004</ref>

Many Nafana are bilingual in [[Twi language|Twi]], the regional [[lingua franca]], to some extent. According to [[SIL International|SIL]], 50% of the people are able to "satisfy routine social demands and limited requirements in other domains", while 20% are able to speak Twi "with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and occupational topics". The remaining 30% are either able to maintain only very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics (15%) or unable to speak Twi at all (15%). 15–25% of the Nafana people are [[literate]] in Twi, whereas only 1–5% are literate in Nafaanra.<ref name="gordon"/><ref>Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. [http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/introduction.asp#language_entries Introduction to the printed volume.] Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Retrieved on 2007-04-10</ref>

Nafaanra is the second language of the approximately 70 [[Dompo language|Dompo]] people living in the close vicinity of Banda. Dompo is their first language, thought to be extinct until a field work trip of Blench in 1998 proved the contrary.<ref>Blench 1999</ref>

===Classification===
[[Maurice Delafosse]] was the first linguist to mention Nafaanra, calling it "a much dispersed Senufo tribe" in 1904.<ref>Delafosse 1904:195</ref> [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann]] in his classification of West-African languages, also grouped Nafaanra with Senufo, apparently based on the word list found in Rapp.<ref>Westermann 1970[1952]:56</ref> This classification is confirmed by Bendor-Samuel, who bases his internal Senufo classification on the comparative word lists in Swadesh et al.<ref name="BS"/><ref>Swadesh et al. 1966</ref>

It is less clear which particular Senufo branch Nafaanra is related to most closely. Bendor-Samuel gives a 60% cognate relationship on the [[Swadesh list]] with "Tenere" (a western Senari dialect), 59% with "Central Senari" (the Senari dialect spoken around Korhogo), and 43% with the non-Senufo languages Mo (or Deg), Kabre (or Kabiye), and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]].<ref name="BS"/> The relatively low scores of about 60% point to a rather distant relationship. Likewise, Mensah and Tchagbale establish an intercomprensibility factor of 38% with "Tyebaara" (Senari), concluding that Nafaanra is only distantly related to this dialect.<ref>Mensah and Tchagbale 1983:19</ref> Nafaanra has been tentatively linked to [[Palaka language|Palaka]] (Kpalaga) by [[Gabriel Manessy|Manessy]], whereas Mills suggests a relation with the southern [[Tagwana–Djimini languages|Tagwana–Djimini]] branch.<ref>Manessy 1981</ref><ref>Mills 1984</ref>

==Sounds==

===Vowels===
Nafaanra has seven oral and five nasalized [[vowel]]s. A difference in vowel length can make a difference in meaning, as in ''{{IPA|sɛ}}'', "to go", vs. ''{{IPA|sɛɛ}}'', "fetish" or ''o'', "we" vs. ''oo'', "we will". Similarly, the phonemic contrastiveness of nasalization can be seen in ''sii'', "to be giving birth," vs. ''{{IPA|sĩĩ}}'', "to build".<ref>Minimal pairs from Jordan 1980b:13–15</ref> The vowel system closely resembles that of other Senufo languages. It is like the two Northern Senufo languages [[Supyire language|Supyire]] and [[Mamara language|Mamara]] in having only five nasal against seven oral vowels.<ref name="Carlson1994">Carlson 1994</ref> In the orthography, [[nasalization]] of vowels is marked by adding the letter "n" after the vowel.

The consonant system of Nafaanra is fairly similar to that of other Senufo languages. Nafaanra has only one attested palatal fricative, {{IPA|/ç/}}, occupying an intermediate position between the Northern Senufo languages (Mamara, Supyire) that have both {{IPA|/ç/}} and its voiced counterpart {{IPA|/ʝ/}}, and the Central and Southern Senufo languages (e.g. Karaboro, Senari, Djimini) that have no palatal fricatives at all.{{fix|text=This would be original research: Nafaanra {{angbr|h}} corresponds to the glottal consonant most other Senufo languages have, either in the form of a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (Supyire, Senari, Karaboro) or a glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}} (Mamara)}}

===Tone===
Like the other Senufo languages, Nafaanra has three contrastive tones: High, Mid and Low. Tone is normally not marked in the Nafaanra orthography. Examples are:<ref name="Jordanb23">Jordan 1980b:23</ref>
* kúfɔ̀ "yam" (High-Low)
* dama "two pesewas (coin)" (Mid)
* màŋà "rope" (Low)
The Mid tone sometimes has a rising feature, the High tone sometimes is subject to [[downstep]] (a tonal process resulting in a High tone being realised lower than a preceding High tone), and an upstep is also found.<ref>Jordan 1980a,b</ref> The "rising feature" of Mid may be related to the fact that two different Mid tones are found in some other Senufo languages (e.g. Sucite and Supyire).<ref name="Carlson1994"/> The High tone downstep (signified by a raised exclamation mark) occurs in the following context:<ref name="Jordanb23"/>

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|we <sup>!</sup> sɛ
|he FUT go
|"he will go".}}

It is likely that the tonal lowering seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).<ref>Carlson 1994:334</ref>
In general however, downstep is more widespread than in Supyire; a similar phenomenon is found in Palaka, Tagwana, and Djimini.<ref>Mills 1984:xvi.</ref>

An upstep is found in the imperative tense of high tone verbs:<ref>Jordan 1980b:24</ref>

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|ki tɔ
|it close
|"close it!"}}

==Grammar==
The Nafaanra syllable comprises a vowel and a maximum of three consonants. A nasal consonant may occur as a syllable on its own, in which case it is called a ''syllabic nasal''. The basic syllable structure can be rendered as (C<sub>1</sub>)(C<sub>2</sub>)V(C<sub>3</sub>), with a preference for CV and CVV. Position C<sub>1</sub> may contain any consonant, although word-initial /r/ does not occur. Position C<sub>2</sub> may contain only [[trill consonant|trills]] (/r/) or [[approximant]]s (/w, l, j/). Position C<sub>3</sub> may contain only nasals ({{IPA|/m n ɲ ŋ/}}), in which case the syllable as a whole is [[nasalization|nasalized]].<ref>Jordan 1980b:2</ref>

Senufo languages have a typical [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] [[noun class]] (or gender) system. [[Suffix]]es on nouns mark membership of one of the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan<ref>Jordan 1980a:1–2</ref> that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.

The basic word order in Nafaanra is [[subject–object–verb]], as can be seen in the following sentence:

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|bibilɛ ná pé nya
|boys PAST them see
|"The boys saw them"}}

===Personal pronouns===
Jordan lists the following list of [[pronoun]]s, commenting, "Although the pronoun system appears quite simple, it becomes complicated because all the tenses are shown by a combination of pronoun plus particle."<ref>Jordan 1980a:6</ref>

===Tense and aspect===
[[Grammatical tense|Tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] in Nafaanra are generally encoded in two places: in preverbal particles and on the verb form. Nafaanra has past, recent past, and future tenses and continuative aspect. In a simple sentence, the order of the various constituents can be rendered as follows: <small> SUBJECT • (NEGATION) • (TENSE) • (ASPECT) • VERB </small>. When the negative suffix ''-n'' is present, no fusing of preverbal particles takes place. Nafaanra additionally expresses some tense/aspect matters by use of certain time adverbs and auxiliary verbs.<ref name="Jordan1978">Jordan 1978</ref>
<!-- Unfortunately no-one has published something on those "time adverbs and auxiliary verbs" in Nafaanra yet... However, refer to Carlson 1994 for an excellent and elaborate overview of TAM in Supyire (Northern Senufo). Carlson calls progressive what Jordan calls continuative. -->

Past tense is marked by the preverbal particle ''ná'' (high tone, as opposed to the low tone continuative particle). Future tense is marked by the particle ''wè''. Simple sentences without a preverbal tense particle are interpreted as recent past (sometimes called ''immediate''). If aspect marking is absent, simple sentences are generally interpreted as ''completive''.<ref>Example sentences adapted from Jordan 1978:85–87.</ref>

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí '''ná''' sɛ́|c1={{audio|kofinase.ogg|&nbsp;}}
|Kofi PAST go-COMPL
|"Kofi went"—<small>PAST</small>}}

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí '''wè''' sɛ́
|Kofi FUT go-COMPL
|"Kofi will go"—<small>FUTURE</small>}}

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí sɛ́
|Kofi go-COMP
|"Kofi just went"—<small>RECENT PAST</small> (no marking)}}

Continuative aspect (sometimes called ''progressive'') denotes an action that is ongoing or repetitive. Continuative aspect is usually marked both by a preverbal particle ''nà'' (low tone) and by a change of the verb form. The verb ''sɛ́'', "go" used in the sentences below has the continuative form ''síé''. In sentences where both past tense particle ''ná'' and continuative particle ''nà'' are present, they combine to give the fused particle ''náà''. In sentences in the recent past tense, the preverbal continuative particle is omitted and continuative aspect is shown only on the verb.<ref name="Jordan1978"/>

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí '''náà''' síé
|Kofi PAST+CONT go-CONT
|"Kofi was going"—<small>CONT + PAST</small>}}
{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí '''wè''' '''nà''' síé
|Kofi FUT CONT go-CONT
|"Kofi will be going"—<small>CONT + FUTURE</small>}}
{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí síé
|Kofi go-CONT
|"Kofi is going"—<small>CONT + RECENT PAST</small>}}

Two classes of verbs can be differentiated on the basis of their behaviour in aspectually marked sentences.<ref>Jordan 1978:85ff.</ref> One class of verbs has two aspectually distinct forms, as seen in the above example sentences. Another class of verbs does not distinguish aspect—one and the same form shows up in both completive and continuative aspect. In sentences in the recent past tense, this gives rise to [[ambiguity]] since the preverbal continuative particle is omitted there. Thus, the sentence ''kòfí blú'' can be interpreted in the following two ways:

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí blú|c1={{audio|kofiblu.ogg|&nbsp;}}
|Kofi swim-CONT
|"Kofi is swimming"—<small>CONT + RECENT PAST</small>}}

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|kòfí blú
|Kofi swim-COMPL
|"Kofi just swam"—<small>RECENT PAST</small> (no marking)}}

Considerable fusion takes place between [[pronoun|pronominal]] subjects and the preverbal particles. For example, ''ná'' "<small>PAST</small>" fuses with ''pé'', "they", to produce ''prá sɛ́'' (they-<small>PAST</small> go-completive), "they went", and ''wè'' "<small>FUTURE</small>" fuses with ''pé'' in ''píè sɛ́'' (they-<small>FUTURE</small> go-completive), "they will go".

===Questions===
[[Question]]s can be formed in several ways in Nafaanra. Basic [[yes–no question]]s are constructed by adding a sentence-final question marker ''rá''. Constituent questions (sometimes called ''Wh-questions'' or ''question word questions'') are doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial question word and are marked with a sentence-final question marker ''hin''.<ref>Examples adapted from Jordan 1980:NAF4</ref>

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|u pan '''rá'''
|he come Q
|"Has he come?"—basic yes–no-question}}

{{interlinear|lang=nfr|indent=3
|'''ŋgi''' wra nya '''hin'''|c1={{audio|Ngiwranya.ogg||&nbsp;}}
|what he+PAST see Q
|"What did he see?"—constituent question}}

===Numbers===
The cardinal numbers without tonal marking are presented below;<ref>Jordan 1980a:2</ref> where possible, the tone pattern is added based on the list in Rapp.<ref>Rapp 1933:66–67</ref> Some Supyire correlates are given for comparison.<ref>As given in Carlson 1994:169</ref> Numbers six to nine are derived by adding the numbers one to four to ''kɔɔ'', "five", by means of the conjunction ''na''.

The numbers 11–19 are formed by adding 1–9 to 10 by means of the conjunction ''mbɔ'', e.g. ''kɛmbɔnunu'', "eleven", ''kɛmbɔkunɔ'', "fifteen". In the tens and higher, the Nafaanra and Supyire systems diverge. Multiplication of ''fulo'', "twenty," and addition of ''kɛ'', "ten", (by means of the conjunction ''ná'') is used to form the 30–90 tens. Perhaps surprisingly, there are considerable differences between Rapp (1933) and Jordan (1980) here. In Rapp's 60, 70 and 80, ''féle'' seems to be used to mark ten, which conjoined with 6, 7 and 8 forms 60, 70 and 80.

Rapp (1933) compares the Nafaanra numerals for three (''táárɛ'') and hundred (''lafaa'') with ''eta'' and ''ke-lafa'' from [[Mpre language|Mpre]], a hitherto unclassified language from Ghana. The Mpre ''eta'' is [[Kwa languages|Kwa]]-like (cf. Brong ''esã'', [[Ga language|Ga]] ''etɛ''), whereas the Nafaanra form ''táárɛ'' is transparently related to the forms found in the other (non-Kwa) Senufo languages (e.g. Supyire ''tàànrè'').  Nafaanra ''lafaa'' "hundred" is a typical Kwa numeral and is most probably borrowed from one of the surrounding Kwa languages (cf. [[Ga language|Dangme]] ''làfá'', [[Gonja language|Gonja]] ''kì-làfá'', [[Ewe language|Ewe]] ''alafá''). Rapp's implication of affinity between Mpre and Nafaanra seems therefore unwarranted at this level.

[[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] alternations occur here and there, most notably the reduction of ''kúnɔ'', "five" to ''kɔ́ɔ̀'' (preserving the tone pattern) and the change from ''lafaa'' to ''lafɛɛ'' in the hundreds.

===Colour words===
The three basic [[colour]] words of Nafaanra are: ''wɔɔ'', "black", ''finge'', "white", and ''ɲiɛ'', "red". As with adjectives in Senufo languages, the form of the colour words reflects the noun class of the noun that is modified.
* ''wɔɔ''—ki ''wɔ'' &nbsp; "it is black"
* ''finge''—ki ''finge'' &nbsp; "it is white"
* ''ɲiɛ''—ki ''ɲina'' &nbsp; "it is red"
The [[cognate]] forms in closely related Supyire are ''-ɲyɛ-'', "red; warm colored", and ''-fyìn-'', "white; light colored", in [[Supyire language|Supyire]]. These adjectives are related to the respective verbs ''fíníŋɛ́'', "be white; whiten" and ''ɲááŋá'', "be red; redden", which in turn are [[causative]] forms of the now defunct verbs ''fini'',"be white" and ''ɲana'', "be red".<ref>Carlson 1994:154,710n9,10</ref>

There is relatively little published on or in the Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to an article on the [[Kulango language]] containing a German-Nafaanra (''Nafana-Sprache'') word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing that special attention was paid to the marking of the tones.<ref>''...besondere Aufmerksamkeit wurde auf die Aufzeichnung der Tonhöhen verwandt'', Rapp 1933:66</ref>

After a period of silence on Nafaanra, Painter (1966) appeared, consisting of basic word lists of the Pantera and Fantera dialects. The SIL linguist Dean Jordan published an article on Nafaanra discourse in 1978, and together with his wife Carol Jordan has produced a translation of the [[New Testament]], which appeared in 1984.<ref>International Bible Society 1984</ref> Kropp-Dakubu's 1980 ''West African language data sheets'' vol II contains a few pages on Nafaanra put together in the late seventies by Dean and Carol Jordan, including a phonology, a list of nouns, a list of pronouns, a list of numbers, and some example sentences; tones are not marked. A more detailed phonology of Nafaanra by Jordan, also containing a [[Swadesh list]], appeared in 1980. Several books of Nafana folk tales have been published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Mensah and Tchagbale in their 1983 linguistic atlas of Ivory Coast include a comparative Senufo word list of about 120 items; Nafaanra is present under the name "Nafara of Bondoukou". An orthography of Nafaanra, lacking tonal marking, is included in Hartell (1993). The area where Nafaanra is spoken has been the subject of recent archaeological-anthropological studies (Stahl 2004).
