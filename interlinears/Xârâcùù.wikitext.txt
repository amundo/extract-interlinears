'''Xârâcùù''' ({{IPA-all|xɑ̃rɑ̃ʧɨː|local}}), or '''Kanala''', is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] spoken in [[New Caledonia]]. It has about 5,000 speakers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Moyse-Faurie|first=Claire|date=June 1997|title=Le xârâcùù: Langue de Thio-Canala (Nouvelle-Calédonie). Éléments de syntaxe|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|doi=10.2307/3623078|volume=36|page=187}}</ref> Xârâcùù is most commonly spoken in the south Central area of New Caledonia in and around the city of [[Canala]] and the municipalities of Canala, [[Thio, New Caledonia|Thio]], and [[Bouloupari|Boulouparis]].

==Current status==
Xârâcùù is considered a recognized teaching language, and is part of New Caledonian culture.  It is predominantly used as the main language in the [[Nouméa]] area, and is not considered endangered by UNESCO due to it being one of the most spoken languages in the area,<ref name=":2" /> with more than 90% of Canala residents being able to speak some form of it.  Xârâcùù is the fourth-most spoken language in New Caledonia Kanak, with a teaching school in the Canala area, although primary language use is at home. Xârâcùù is taught in the Canala area due to the EPK (''École Populaire Kanak''), founded by Marie-Adele Néchérö Jorédié.  It is the only language that is being taught in the area and is taught in nursery, primary, two secondary schools, Thio (maternal Kouare village school and also in college) and in kindergartens in La Foa and Sarramea.<ref name=":2" />

Xârâcùù has been taught since 1980 at the primary level in the popular Kanak school (EPK or Ecole Populaire Kanak) Canala, only establishment of its kind still existing in 2013, the students can then join public education. The language is also offered at the private Catholic college Francis Rouge-Thio and public college Canala.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sorosoro.org/le-xaracuu/|title=Le xârâcùù «  Sorosoro|website=www.sorosoro.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}</ref>

==Phonology and spelling==
=== Phonology ===
The language has twenty-seven consonant phonemes, ten [[oral vowels]], seven [[Nasal vowel|nasal vowels]] and seventeen corresponding [[Vowel length|long vowels]].  Current research has shown that there are numerous phonemic contrasts, which leaves little room for allophonic variation.<ref name=":0" /> Xârâcùù has 27 consonants, some of which are nasalized plosives that are quite typical of [[Oceanic languages]]. {{IPA|/l/}} is only found in loanwords.<ref name=":2" />

Efforts to determine the phonological history of the language have been met with difficulty due to Xârâcùù's lack of reflexes of established [[Proto-Oceanic]] forms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=John|date=June 1997|title=Review of: ''Le xârâcùù: Langue de Thio-Canala (Nouvelle-Calédonie). Éléments de syntaxe''|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|doi=10.2307/3623078}}</ref>  

===Orthography===
Xârâcùù is written with the [[Latin alphabet]] combined with many [[Diacritic|diacritics]] and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], with a total of 61 [[Grapheme|graphemes]]. This writing system was developed in the early 1980s by {{ill|Claire Moyse-Faurie|fr|}} (from [[CNRS]]-[[LACITO]]). (Previously, missionaries used to transcribe the language (especially to produce versions of the Gospels or catechism) with the same conventions as the [[Ajië language]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alk.nc/langues/xaracuu|title=Xaracuu|website=Academie Des Langues Kanak|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref>)

The orthography of Xârâcùù follows many of the same principles as most other New Caledonian languages: e.g. symbols usually used for voiced consonants (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', ''j'', etc.) represent [[prenasalized consonant]]s. Digraphs are used for a number of phonemes, e.g. ''bw'', ''gw'' and ''ny'' for /ᵐbʷ/, /ᵑɡʷ/, /ɲ/ respectively; ''ch'' stands for /ʃ/, as in [[French orthography|French]]. The large number of contrasting vowels and the inclusion of vowel clusters and vowel length mean that accents and other diacritics have to be used to represent vowel phonemes.<ref name=":0" /> Like in other languages of New Caledonia, [[nasal vowel]]s are mostly indicated using a [[circumflex]] diacritic.

===Noun phrase structure===
In comparison to other Oceanic languages, Xârâcùù's noun phrase structure is a little different. Most of the vowel modifiers in Xârâcùù come before the head. Some articles that feature this include ''a'' singular, ''du'' dual, ''ké'' paucal, and ''mîî~mîrî'' plural.<ref name=":0" />  There are several different morphemes for '10' and '15' which are just examples of a [[quinary numeral system]].

===Numerals===
The numeral style of the language allows for few [[numeral classifiers]] that often only occur as suffixes to the number one and as prefixes to all of the other [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] in the language.

=== Prepositions ===
Xârâcùù has at least 17 known [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]], at least half referring to direction or location. Three prepositions express types of [[comitative|comitative relationships]].<ref name=":0" />

===Possession===
Like many Oceanic languages, Xârâcùù features indirect and direct possession constructions. The following phrases demonstrate that "inalienable" nouns are directly possessed with the possessor, whether pronoun or noun, being directly suffixed to the possessed noun.<ref name=":0" /> 

{{interlinear|indent=4
|nêêwâ-rö
|daughter-2SG
|"your daughter"}}

{{interlinear|indent=4
|nâxwâ-pârâ
|mouth-eel
|'the eel's mouth'}}

Indirect possession comes in two syntactic types varying by familiarity and a classification system. Seven possessive classifications have possessive pronominal suffix or are joined by the possessed noun. These classifiers usually refer to food ''nênê-'' (allomorph ''nânâ-''), starchy foods or ''nèkê-'', meat or ''(nê)wînè'', food to be chewed or ''nèxêê-'', drinks or ''(nê)wînyè-'', tubers to be planted or harvested or ''nêngê-'', and goods possessions or ''ngêê'' or ''êê''.  There are also three other qualifiers including: ''xû'' or topic of story telling, ''(rö)wâ'' or passive, and ''rè'' or general.  In these cases the possessed noun comes first followed by the classifier and the possessor. A pronominal possessor does not occur as a suffix but rather a free form.<ref name=":0" />

{{interlinear|indent=4
|Nânâ-râ nô
|Food-1SG fish
|'my fish (to eat)'}}

{{interlinear|indent=4
|nô rè nâ
|fish General 1SG
|'my (pet) fish'}}

===Morphology===
There are only a few forms of verbal [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in Xârâcùù.  These include the nonproductive [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] suffix ''–ri'', the causative ''fa-'', the resultative/stative ''mê-'', and the intransitivizer ''ù-''.  While transitive suffix do exist they are few and far between leaving the language to follow a strict SVO format for morphological marking.    

{{interlinear|indent=4
|Chaa xûûchi fa-mêgörö na vèè a	
|One Child CAUS-break PAST glass DEM
|'A child broke this glass.'}}

{{interlinear|indent=4
|vèè a, chaa xûûchi fa-mêgörö na
|glass DEM, one child CAUS-break PAST
|'This glass, a child broke it.'}}

===Verb phrases===
The examples also show that the object of a sentence can be topicalized by fronting the transitive suffix  as in ''vèè a-'' moving to the front of the sentence in example two.  There is also reduplication, which acts like a functions intensifier.  While there is a small amount of verbal morphology, each verb phrase can contain a preverbal subject-marking pronoun.  Subject and Predicate phrase order is unmarked in Xarâcùù. There are ten tense-aspect markers (some are preverbal others postverbal) and one or more modifiers can be included (also pre-verbal or post-verbal).<ref name=":0" />

{{interlinear|indent=4
|pa dopwa pia
|COLLECTIVE young fight:REFL
|The young people are fighting}}

{{interlinear|indent=4
|ri pia, ngê pa dopwa
|3PL fight:REFL PREP COLLECTIVE young
|They're fighting each other, the young people (are)}}

As seen above in example (1), preverbal subject markers are unused if the subject is a noun phrase.  But there are cases when there is a topicalized afterthought subject that follows the verb as seen in the second example where ''pa dopwa'' appears at the end rather than the beginning.  Polar interrogatives also exist in Xarâcùù but are marked by the particle ''kae''.  The ''kae'' article follows the constituent that is the focus of the interrogation.

{{interlinear|indent=4
|è xwa kae na âmu?
|3SG rain INTERROG PAST yesterday
|Did it rain yesterday?}}

{{interlinear|indent=4
|è xwa na âmu kae?
|3SG rain PAST yesterday INTERROG
|Was it yesterday that it rained?}}

In comparison to many other Oceanic languages outside of [[New Caledonia]], Xarâcùù uses unusual phrase structure for nouns.  The modifiers precede the head and the only thing that follows are demonstratives and markers of totality.

{{interlinear|indent=4
|Mîî bachèè xuu pa xùùchî nä
|ART:PL three small COLLECTIVE child DEM
|Those three small children}}

The vine flower

It is a vine flower that the wind brought.

It is set on a mountain on which grew a banyan tree called.

She landed on her foot and took root there.

She climbed the tree and there developed antlers. The vine grows again, it bore fruit.

One day came a man, a leader, master of the mountain.

He went rummaging among the thick foliage of the vine and asked:

"Where are you from? "

She said

" I come from far away, the wind brought me here. "

The leader asked again," what's your name? "

She told him:

" My name is victuals. I fed the man through my tubers. "

The years passed and the vine gave tubers, fruits and multiplied.

It was the surrogate mother several yam varieties.

Intrigued by this vine, the man dug a tuber.

He did cook fire and ate it .

he found him a good taste and was full.

that pleased him and he cultivated.

that's why today we grow yams.

So ends this story.

It took leave of his mother and of his family who gave him his blessing because Jari was to return to his family to eventually marry her.

She went on a journey to find a place where s' install.

Jari kwere left so she left and began its march Ka. She visited all Canala but did not find a place to settle.

Jari then thought of going to the Loyalty Islands but this was impossible because being a young girl fresh water, salt water was not profitable to him.

she turned her gaze to Thio then went to visit. But she did not found where settle for freshwater Thio was bitter.

She crossed the central chain and reached Burupwari. The environment did not suit him because the place was hollow.

She went down to the Cîîrî country but could not settle there either. She then went to Jawa countries, the medium does not always pleased him.

Crossing the central chain for the second time, Jari came to Xajië country. She went to explore the country and found where to settle.

Jari then returned to his family and told his journey and informed them that she had found a nice place to settle.

His family: his parents and brothers and sisters gathered his things and went to leave there, in Neja.

his family took him there and left there when she multiplied it.

End.

==Documentation==

There have been two dictionaries written on the Xârâcùù language in the last one hundred years. 

The earlier work is a short English/Xârâcùù dictionary published in 1975 by [[George W. Grace|George William Grace]], titled ''Canala dictionary (New Caledonia)''.

A more substantial dictionary is the one published in 1986 by {{ill|Claire Moyse-Faurie|fr|}}, titled ''Dictionnaire Xârâcùù-Français (Nouvelle-Calédonie)''. 

Another key publication is Moyse-Faurie's 1995 grammar ''Le xârâcùù: Langue de Thio-Canala (Nouvelle-Calédonie)''.
