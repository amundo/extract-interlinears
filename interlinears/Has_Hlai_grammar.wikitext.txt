This article is a description of the [[grammar]] of standardized [[Has Hlai language|Has Hlai]], a [[Hlai languages|Hlai language]] spoken on the island of [[Hainan]], China by the [[Hlai people|Hlai]] (Li) ethnic group. The parts of speech are nouns, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, numerals, adverbs, and pronouns.{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=56–57}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=91–92}}

== Introduction ==
The [[Li people|Hlai people]] (or, as they are called in Chinese, the Li - 黎族) are the original inhabitants of southern Hainan. A [[Kra–Dai-speaking peoples|Kra–Dai people]], they are believed to have settled there at least 2,000 to 6,000 years ago, and carry genetic markers from ancient people who reached the island between 7,000 and 27,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Min-Sheng|last2=He|first2=Jun-Dong|last3=Liu|first3=Hai-Xin|last4=Zhang|first4=Ya-Ping|date=2011-02-15|title=Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islanders - a perspective from mitochondrial DNA|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-11-46|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-46|issn=1471-2148|doi-access=free}}</ref> The [[Proto-Hlai language|Pre-Hlai]] language they spoke would later evolve into [[Proto-Hlai language|Proto-Hlai]], and from there into the modern [[Hlai languages]].

In June 1956, China's government implemented research on Hainan Island of the [[Hlai people]]'s language.

A 1983 report, ''Liyu diaocha yanjiu'' (黎语调查研究),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ouyang Jueya 欧阳觉亚 & Zheng Yiqing 郑贻青|title=Liyu diaocha yanjiu 黎语调查研究|publisher=Beijing: Zhongguo Shehui Kexue Chubanshe 中国社会科学出版社|year=1983|pages=4}}</ref> claimed that the Hlai language is made up of five languages{{Clarify|date=April 2021}}: Has [[侾黎]], Gheis [[杞黎]], Hyuuen [[本地黎]], Moeifou [[美孚黎]], and Deitou [[Jiamao language|加茂黎]]. For education, the Lauxhuet dialect of Has ({{lang-zh|侾方言罗活土语|links=no}}) in Ledong Baoyou [[Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County|Baoding]] ({{lang-zh|乐东抱由镇保定村|links=no}}) was chosen to be the Li's standardized language. It was this Language from which the "Li orthography" ({{lang-zh|黎文方案|links=no}}) was developed.

In September 1984, two organizations, [[Central University for Nationalities]] and the [[中国社会科学院|Institute of Minorities in Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], made some revisions to the Li orthography. The Hlai language's orthography was finalized with the publishing of a textbook entitled ''Basic Li Course'' (Pinyin: ''Liyu Jichu Jiaocheng;'' Chinese: 黎语基础教程).{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006}}

At the end of 2019, a Hlai-language dictionary was officially posted online ([http://www.tunhlai.com/ http://www.tunhlai.com]).

=====Nations=====

====[[Abstract noun]]s  ====
These nouns are mostly loan words. The Hlai language being both practical and concrete in nature, is not suitable for describing anything intangible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== The basic rules for [[Noun]]s in Hlai language{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=58–61}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2009|p=20}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=91–92}}===

1. Nouns usually cannot be modified by [[number]] alone; the number needs a proper [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] following the number to modify the noun.
:''zuu lang dzax,'' (a/one  classifier  snake) "a snake"

But, nouns associated with dates (like year, month, day), are modified with numbers alone (no classifiers).

:''fus boux'' (three year) "three years"
:''hlaus  hwan'' (two day) "two days"
:''ba nyaen'' (five month) "May"

When the word "nyaen" refers to the name of a month (as May above), a number can modify "nyaen" without a classifier. However, when the word "nyaen" refers to the number of months (as below), a classifier is required to modify the word "nyaen."

:''ba hom nyaen'' (five  classifier  month) "five months"

2. Nouns cannot be modified by [[adverb]]s, nor can a noun be doubled (e.g., **''uxaeu uxaeu'', "man man"; **''blongs blongs'', "house house") to express the meaning of "every" as is done in Chinese. The way to present the meaning of "every" is to use the word "ranx" plus a proper classifier as below:

:''ranx    zuen        uxaeu'' (every classifier  man/one) "everyone"
:''ranx    hom         blongs'' (every classifier  house) "every house"

3. Although the Hlai language does not have [[declension]] of gender, it does have two [[prefix]]es to indicate the gender: "bais" for female and "pas" for male, e.g.

:''pasdza'', "father"
:''baisdza'', "mother"
:''paskai'', "cock/rooster"（''kai'': chicken）
:''baiskai'', "hen"
:''pasdzuengsgong'', "salesman" （''dzuengs'': sale, ''gong'': stuff）
:''baisdzuengsgong'', "saleswoman"

When the word "bais" exists alone, the meaning is mother; "pas" means father. "Pas" could also be used as a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], e.g.,

:''Kun hluuekmuuen  hauux  zuu  pas lax  zuu  hom.'' (Plural_marker  young_man     those  one   classifier  eat  one  classifier) "Each of those young men ate one."

4.The Hlai language does not use [[suffix]]es or prefixes for nouns to denote [[Plurality (linguistic)|plurality]] as in the English language. But, the Hlai language uses the word "kun" to indicate the plurality of nouns, e.g.

:''Kun aeudza rien tun raeu dhuus  fou cai.''  (Plural_marker old_man say/talk/speak word laugh in under  tree) "The old men were telling jokes under the tree."

The word "kun" can also be used together with a [[Number (linguistics)|number]] and a classifier to modify nouns, e.g.,

:''Kun hlaus  zuen  kauus fuuek   riens paens.'' (Plural_marker  two classifier  older_sister  weave  skirt decorative_pattern) "The two older sisters were weaving skirts with a decorative pattern."

5. A noun can be a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], [[Object (grammar)|object]], e.g.

("cai" as subject and "ceeng" as object)

:''cai tuuen ceeng'' (Tree out_of flower) "trees bloom (flowers)"

("veengs" as subject and "veengs" as predicate)

:''Veengs    hauux  veengs     meuu.'' (shirt/top  that shirt/top you (sg.)) "That shirt/top is yours."

6. A noun can be an attribute, and also can be modified by [[Attribute (grammar)|attributes]] e.g.
:''Meuu kweis ojiep  caqias  Hlai da?'' (You want learn script Li {{sc|question}}) "Do you want to learn Hlai script?"

7.  A noun can also be an [[adverbial]] modifier, e.g.
:''Tong neix cai vuek.'' (''tong''  this  tree/wood  do/make) "This hookah is made out of wood." (''tong'' = An apparatus for smoking, such as a hookah)

8.    A noun in relation to time can even be an adverbial modifier to modify a [[verb]], e.g.
:''Hwanneix   fous  dhat  lo!'' (Today hot very {{sc|emphasis}}) "It's so hot today!"
:''Na uunyeuu hei zok das.'' (He/she day_after_tomorrow go to/toward  mother's_mother) "He is going to grandma's house the day after tomorrow."
:''Fa   uupans     beuuluueng.'' (We  yesterday  come_ back) "We came back yesterday."

9.  When the word "guu" is placed before a noun to indicate [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]], this combination functions as a [[Possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] [[phrase]], and can only be in the predicate of the sentence, e.g.
:''Vabheny  neix guu Dongxgok.'' (Airplane   this {{sc|poss}} China) "This airplane belongs to China."
:''Hlaus  lang duis neix  guu Laufus.'' (Two classifier water_buffalo  this  {{sc|poss}}  Mr. Fu) "These two water buffaloes belong to Mr. Fu."

=== The basic rules for [[Verb]]s in Hlai language{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=62–77}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=96–99}}===

==== 1.     In Hlai language, verbs never change their form. The placement of an adverb or an [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] word after or before a verb determines the verb's [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. ====
===== A.    [[Progressive aspect]] =====
The adverbial word "''faets''" or "''fietla''" can express the action in process, and is placed before a verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Na '''faets''' lax tax.
|he/she ADV.PROG eat rice
|"He is eating." ({{lang-zh|他 正在 吃 饭}})}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Daty '''faets''' bheny.
|bird ADV.PROG fly
|"The birds are flying." ({{lang-zh|鸟 正在 飞}})}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Hluuek na '''fietla''' laix dax.
|child he/she ADV.PROG plough field
|"His children/child are/is plowing the field." ({{lang-zh|他的孩子正在犁田}})}}

===== B.    [[Perfect aspect]] =====
The verbs with the word "''bhaeis''" expresses an action that has already happened. If "''bhaeis''" is placed before a verb, it is an adverbial,e.g.,

''Hluuek  na         bhaeis                                              hei  ang  he.''

child     he/she  adverbial word of perfective aspect  go field  accent

"他的孩子已经去山栏地了，His children/child already went to the field."

''Pashlaus       na         bhaeis                                               bleuu  fan    rien,''

older brother  he/she  adverbial word of perfective aspect  hear   then  say

''"Eis,      hluumsghweuu na          guu.                                  loms        cas da?"''

Accent  don't know        he/she auxiliary of future aspect still/again or    not

"他哥哥（已经）听了便说，"哎，不知道他还要这样不?"，

When his brother heard of it, he said, "Oh, I don't know that he would still do that (or) not?"

If the word "bhaeis" is placed after a verb, it acts as a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] and means "finished", e.g.,

''Hou  lax   tax bhaeis    goms  hei.''

I        eat  rice finished  then    go

"我吃完饭就去，After I finish dinner, I'll go."

The word "dhuas" can also denote the perfect aspect, ("(1) v.: pass through; (2) an auxiliary word that indicates that an action has already happened, and is placed after the verb; (3) an auxiliary word that expresses a comparison, and is placed after the adjective") e.g.,

''Meuu  laeis  zuu zuen         aeu                   neix  dhuas    cas  da?''

you     see    one classifier  person/people  this  auxiliary  or    not

"你见过这个人吗？Have you ever seen this man?"

''Dhes  da   rien            dhongneix  dhuas.''

I         not  say/speak like this       auxiliary

"我没有说过这样的话，I didn't say anything like that."

===== C.    [[Future tense|Future aspect]] =====
The auxiliary word "''kweis''" or "''guu''" indicates that an action is in future by being placed before a verb, e.g.,

''Na        kweis                               hei  Damxax.''

he/she auxiliary word for future  go   Sanya city

"他要去三亚，He is going to Sanya."

''Meuu  kweis                              vuek         meshes?''

you     auxiliary word for future  do/make  what

"你要干什么？What will you do?"

The nuance between the two words "''kweis''" and "''guu''" is that: when two verbs are used together, if the first one is the method of the second one, or the second one is the purpose of the first one, only the word "''guu''" can be placed before the second verb, e.g.,

''Bhoek  noms  guu                        roengx  tax.''

carry    water  for the purpose of  cook    rice

"打水煮饭，bring the water (used) for cooking"

===== D.    Others =====
If an action only lasts for a short while, the adverbial word "''zuufanx''" is placed after the verb, e.g.,

''Gaux      zuufanx.''

lie down  a short while

"躺一会儿，Liedown (for) a short while."

''Duuengx        hou  cat      zuufanx.''

to let/to allow  I,      wear  a short while

"给我穿一下子，Let me wear it (for) a short while."

==== 2.    Hlai verbs, including action verbs, verbs for expressing mental activities, and verbs for expressing existence, change, and development, can be predicates or predicate heads in a sentence. Most of these verbs can be followed by objects or by complements, and can be modified by adverbials, nouns of time, and auxiliary words, e.g., ====

''Dhes  naeus  buuen.''

I          just     come

"我刚来，I just came here."

''Mieu gaenys diu.''

cat    bite       mouse

"猫咬老鼠，A cat bites a mouse."

''Pasdza  dhuus    blongs.''

father    exist/in house

"父亲在家，Father is at home."

''Meuu  uuhaux      kweis                              hei  da？''

you    tomorrow  auxiliary word for future  go  not

"你明天去吗？Are you going tomorrow (or not)?"

==== 3.    Hlai verbs, except for linking verbs, can usually be made [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] by adding a prefix "''uu-''"; nominal verbs can be a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], but cannot be a major part of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], e.g., ====

''Uu-     laix    hauux  dax hou.''

prefix   plow  that    field  my

"那犁过的是我的田，The field that has been plowed is mine."

''Uu-     buuen  hauux  ghueng                          dhes.''

prefix  come   that      young brother or sister  my

"那个来的是我的弟弟（妹妹），The one who is coming is my brother/sister."

Nominal verbs still can function as a verb with an object following it; the nominal verb and the object together can function as a subject, object or nominal predicate, e.g.,

''Duis     neix  man  uu-    duuengx  hlausghueng.''

buffalo this   is      prefix give          relatives

"这牛是给亲戚的，The buffalo is for (giving to) the relatives."

''Uu-     oep  hou man  dhangjis  hou.''

prefix  love  me   is     comrade my

"爱我的是我的同志，The one who loves me is my comrade."

==== 4.    Hlai verbs are rarely doubled as they are in Chinese; only monosyllabic action verbs and verbs for expressing mental activities can be doubled. Doubled [[Monosyllable|monosyllabic]] verbs imply that the action is casually and carelessly done, e.g., ====

''Na       bleuu  bleuu  fan   beuu.''

he/she  hear    hear  then  go back

"他听了听就回去了，He (only) heard about/of it and went back."

''Kun                 hluuekueng  dzueis dzueis fan    fei     hluet    blongs.''

plural marker  young girl     look     look    then  walk  go into house

"姑娘们看了看就走进屋里去了，The girls (only) taking a quick look, then went into the house."

A verb followed by "''laeis''" comes to mean "to try"; if a verb is followed by an object, the word "''laeis''" should be placed after the object, e.g.,

''Hou  qim    laeis.''

I        taste  try

"我尝尝看，I'll try (to taste) it."

''Meuu      dzueis dhang  na        laeis.''

You (s.)  look     face     he/she  try

"你看看他的脸，You try to look at his face."

==== 5.    [[Modal verb]]s are usually placed before a verb forming the predicate of a sentence to express 1) the ability of the one performing the action, or 2) the possibility, obligation, or need of the action, e.g., ====

''Dhes  kueng         rien             tun     Moei.''

I          know how  say/speak  word  Han/Chinese

"我会讲汉语，I can speak Chinese."

''Meuu  kiemx            hei  geek       guns.''

You     should/must  go   look for  firewood

"你应该去砍柴，You should look for firewood."

''Meuu  guulax           dhongneix  vuek  naus dhiu.''

you     should/must  like this       do     just    right

"你必须这样做才对，You must do (it) like this, (for it) to be done just right."

''Meuu  gieu            vuek  meshes?''

You     be good at  do     what

"你能干什么？What are you good at?"

''Na        boei                 taeis   zuu hom         qias    neix.''

he/she  be not able to write  one  classifier  script  this

"他不会写这个字，He does not know how to write this one script."

''Hou  dheeng'hwoek       vuek.''

I        be willing to/agree  do

"我愿意/同意做，I am willing to (do that) / I agree to (do that)."

''Meuu  kweis            beuu   na        da?''

You     be willing to marry  he/she  not

"你愿意嫁他吗？Are you willing to marry him?"

''Na         ais                      vuek.''

he/she  be not willing to  do

"他不愿意做，He is not willing to (do that)."

''Na       gax               vuek  gong neix.''

he/she  be not able  do     work  this

"他无法做这个工作，He is not able to do this work."

''Na        loepp                                buuen.''

he/she  be allowed to/be able to  come

"他可以来，He is able to come. / He is allowed to come."

''Hou  auux      taeix hapaeu.''

I        dare to      shoot

"我敢打枪，I dare to shoot."

Modal verbs cannot be followed by noun-objects, nor can modal verbs be doubled, except in an interrogative sentence, that a positive and negative modal verb is used to ask yes or no,e.g.,

''Meuu  kueng        da   kueng?''

You     know how  not know how

"你会不会？Do you know how to do it (or not)?"

Only in answering questions, can a modal verb act alone as a predicate, except for the modal verbs "kiemx", "guulax" and the word "guu", which cannot act as a predicate, e.g.,

''Meuu  gieu           rien             tun    Hlai cas  da? Dhes  '''gieu'''.''

You     be able to say/speak  word  Li    or    not? I        be able to

"你能说黎语吗？我能，Can you speak the Hlai/Li language? I can."

Modal verbs sometimescan be followed by an object, e.g.,

''Na  bhaeis  o                          kueng        qias    Hlai  he.''

he  already  learn (loan word)  know how script  Li     accent

"他已经学会黎文了，He already learned the Hlai's/Li's script."

The [[Opposite (semantics)|antonym]] of the modal verb "''kweis''" is "''ais''"; the antonym of "''kueng''" is "''hluums''", and that of "''gieu''" is "''gax''", which cannot be used in the [[imperative mood]].

==== 6.    [[Verb framing|Verbs of motion]] can act alone as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], e.g., ====

''Uengxtoengs buuen  res!''

everyone         come   accent

"大家来吧！Everyone, come!"

Also, verbs of motion can follow a main verb to express the direction of the action forming a predicate, e.g.,

''Dhes  fei     hluet    blongs.''

I         walk  go into house

"我走进屋里，I walked into the house."

''Na       tuuen  blongs  ghoux tuuen   buuen.''

he/she  from    house  run      go out  come

"他从屋里跑出来，He ran out of the house."

''Zuufanx         blei    hei,      zuufanx          blei    luueng.''

a short while  swim  go to, a short while  swim  go back

"一会儿游去，一会儿游回，swim back and forth."

Also, verbs of motion can combine together and become [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]] as can be seen in the chart below:
{| class="wikitable" width="467"
| width="106" valign="top" |
| width="120" valign="top" |buuen (来, to come)
| width="120" valign="top" |hei (去, to go to)
| width="120" valign="top" |beuu (回, to go back)
|-

| width="120" valign="top" |heiluei，下去
| width="120" valign="top" |beuuluei，回去，下去
|-
| width="106" valign="top" |hluet (进, into)

| width="120" valign="top" |buuenbeuu，回来
| width="120" valign="top" |heibeuu，回去
| width="120" valign="top" |
|}
 
The compound words above can be followed by objects, e.g.,

''Hou  hwanneix  bhaeis   duengx      heikaen  hwous.''

I        today        already carry/bring  go up     mountain

"我今天已经送到山上去，I have already brought (it) to the mountain today."

''Pasdza   ghuis          na        heihluet  hwous     hloek.''

Father    lead/direct  he/she go into    mountain  deep

"父亲带他进入深山，Father took him into the remote mountains."

''Pasbhanghlauux fan    beuuluueng  blongs.''

name of a man    then  come back   home

"Pasbhanghlauux 便回家去，Then, Pasbhanghlauux went home."

Except for the word "''luueng''", the words found in the first column of the chart ("''dhuas''", "''kaen''", "''luei''", "''hluet''", "''tuuen''", and "''beuu''") and the words found along the top row ("''buuen''", "''hei''", and "''beuu''") can exchange positions. After exchanging positions, the compound words cannot be followed by an object, and usually are used in [[imperative mood]].

==== 7.    [[Linking verb]]s are placed before nouns, [[noun phrase]]s or [[pronoun]]s, combining two grammatical parts as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to provide information about the objects, e.g., ====

''Hou  man  Hlai, ghwaix  Moei.''

I        am    Li,    am not   Han/Chinese

"我是黎族，不是汉族，I am a Li, not a Han."

''Na  man  pashlaus        hou.''

He  is      older brother  my

"他是我的哥哥，He is my older brother."

The linking verbs can be omitted, e.g.,

''Na pasghueng         hou.''

He  younger brother  my

"他是我的弟弟，He is my younger brother."

But, when the subject or predicate is too long, or when the predicate includes numbers, the linking verbs cannot be omitted, e.g.,

''Gha  uengxtoengs bhaeisbhaeis  ruus  man uxaeu   Dongxgok.''

We    everyone        all                   all      are  people  China

"咱们大家都是中国人，All of us are Chinese."

Linking verbs cannot go with words that indicate the tense (like "faets" or "bhaeis" or "dhuas"), nor with directional verbs or with the complement, nor be modified by adverbials, or be doubled.

==== 8.    When the [[suffix]] "toengs" is added to some verbs, the compound words become reciprocal verbs, and cannot be followed by any objects, e.g., ====

''Duis                tut'toengs.''

Water buffalo  collide with each other

"牛互相碰撞，The buffaloes collided with each other."

''Na         hlaus zuen         oeptoengs         dhat.''

He/she  two     classifier love each other  truly

"他们两人很相爱，The two of them love each other very much."

==== 9.    Some words in Hlai language are both nouns and verbs, e.g., ====
{| class="wikitable"
!
! noun
! verb
|-
!''fun''
| {{interlinear|top= 大雨|fun long|rain big|"heavy rain"}}
| {{interlinear|top= "下雨了！|fun bhe!|rain, accent|It is raining!"}}
|-
! ''coem''
| {{interlinear|top= 果子|coem cai|fruit tree|"fruit"}}
| {{interlinear|top= 树结果|cai coem|tree {bear fruit}|"The tree bears fruit."}}
|-
! ''dzuuem''
| {{interlinear|top= 鸡蛋|dzuuem kai|egg chicken|"chicken egg"}}
| {{interlinear|top= 鸡下蛋|kai dzuuem|chicken {lay egg}|"The chicken is laying an egg."}}
|-
! ''haeis''
| {{interlinear|top= 牛屎|haeis duis|excrement {water buffalo}|"water buffalo's excrement"}}
| {{interlinear|top= 牛拉屎|duis haeis|{water buffalo} excrement|"The water buffalo is defecating."}}
|}

In Chinese and English, the verb "wear" can apply to different actions, like wearing a necklace, wearing a hat, or wearing earrings. However, in Hlai language these different actions are distinguished by different verbs, e.g.,

* "to wear"
** ''kienx'' (for wearing a necklace);
** ''mieng'' (for wearing earrings);
** ''ngwaus'' (for wearing a hat);
** ''pien'' (for wearing a skirt, pants, shoes);
** ''cat'' (for wearing a top, a shirt)
* "noise"
** ''roeng'' (from an insect or bird);
** ''vuns'' (from a dog);
** ''hyoen'' (from a rooster);
** ''ngwaety'' (from a human)

=== The basic rules for Adjectives in Hlai language{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=71–77}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2009|p=20}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|p=103}}===

==== 1.     In Hlai language, adjectives cannot be a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], nor an [[Object (grammar)|object]], but can act as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], [[Attribute (grammar)|attribute]], [[adverbial]], or [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]. ====

===== A.    As a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] =====
The adjective goes after the subject, e.g.,

''Zuu  hom        coem  hauux  long        baisias.''

One  classifier  fruit    that     big/large  very much

"那一个果子很大，That fruit (is) large!"

''Zuu  zuen        aeu               max   reek.''

One  classifier  man/person there  bad

"那一个人坏，That man (is) bad/notorious."

===== B.   As an [[Attribute (grammar)|attribute]] =====
The adjective goes after the noun that is modified, e.g.,

''dhop  kieu''

cloth  blue/green

"蓝布，(a) blue cloth"

''veengs    paens''

shirt/top  colorful

"花衣服，(a) loud (pronounced colors) shirt"

''fun   long''

rain  big

"大雨，heavy rain"

''hwous      enyx''

mountain  small

"小山，(a) small mountain / hill"

''blongs  peek''

house   tall

"高房子，(a) tall house"

''ceeng  hleny''

flower  good

"好花，(a) pretty flower"

===== C.   As an [[adverbial]] =====
The adjective is placed before the verb, e.g.,

''Meuu  dais  dais   lax  as.''

You     slow  slow  eat  an accent

"你慢慢地吃吧！(You) Eat slowly."

''Na         kauuspaeis      fei.''

He/she  swift in action  walk

"他迅速地走，He walked quickly."

===== D.    As a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] =====
The adjective usually comes after the verb in a sentence, e.g.,

''Na         vuek       reek he.''

He/she  do/make  bad  an accent

"他弄坏了，He has broken (it)."

''Meuu  bhaeis  laix    hleny  hyos?''

You     already  plow well    marker of question

"你已经犁好了吗？Have you finished plowing?"

==== 2.    An adjective also can be modified by adverbs, which can be placed either before or after the adjective, e.g., ====

''da   hleny''

not  good

"不好，not good"

''da   peek''

not  tall

"不高，not tall"

''vaeu  reek''

most  bad

"最坏，worst"

''duix  hlenymuuen''

most  beautiful

"最美丽，most beautiful"

''paens             dhatdhat''

colorful/floral truly/really

"很花，very colorful"

''hlenyfaty  baisias''

happy       very much

"很高兴，very happy"

==== 3.     In Hlai language, adjectives have [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] degrees. ====

===== A.    [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] degree =====
Either "''dhuas''" or "''bhi''", denote comparative degree; the former one is a Hlai word, the latter a loan word. If the word "''dhuas''" is used, it should be placed after the adjective, and the adjective and "''dhuas''" should be placed between the two objects being compared, e.g.,

''Baisdza  peek  dhuas         hluuekbaiskaux.''

Mother    tall     more than  daughter

"母亲高过女儿，The mother is taller than her daughter."

''Zuuhwuuep                        long   dhuas        zuu'ei.''

Winter melon/white gourd   big    more than  pumpkin

"冬瓜大过南瓜，The white gourd is bigger than her pumpkin."

If the loan word "''bhi''" is used, it is placed between the two objects being compared, and the adjective is placed after the latter object, e.g.,

''Meuu  bhi          dhes  peek.''

You     compare  I        tall

"你比我高，You are taller than I (am)."

''Blongs  dhes bhi           blongs  na hleny.''

House    my    compare house   his  good

"我的房子比他的房子好，My house is better than his."

===== B.   [[Comparison (grammar)|superlative]] degree =====
Either "''vaeu''" or "''duix''", denote superlative degree; the former one is a Hlai word, the latter a loan word. If either "''vaeu''" or "''duix''" is used, it should be placed before the adjective, e.g.,

''Pashlaus         vaeu gieu.''

Older brother most  capable

"哥哥最能干，The older brother is most capable."

''Baiscuty                  duix  hlenymuuen.''

Youngest daughter  most  beautiful

"幺妹最漂亮，The youngest daughter is most beautiful."

According to my Hlai language consultant, Mr. Liu, "The word '''veau''' could possibly imply a derogatory, an exaggerated or overstated statement." It depends on the context.

===== C.   Others =====

"''Zuugit''", instead of indicating comparative or superlative degrees, denotes "(just) a little bit", e.g.,

''Zuu  kuuengx  cai   neix  peek zuugit.''

One  classifier  tree this   tall     a little bit

"这棵树高一点，This three is just a little bit taller."

''Veengs    neix baen  zuugit.''

shirt/top  this   new  a little bit

"这衣服新一点，This dress is just a little bit newer."

==== 4.    Except for adjectives that describe a mental/emotional status, adjectives can be made [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] by adding the [[prefix]] "''uu-''". Adjectives that are nominal cannot be a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], but can act as a subject, an object, or an [[Attribute (grammar)|attribute]], e.g., ====

''Uu-hleny          neix man  guu                                meuu.''

The good one  this    is     a maker of possession  you

"这个好的是你的，This good one is yours."

''Na         qieng     dheuu uu-daeus.''

He/she  want to  take    the long one

"他想拿长的，He wants to take the long one."

''Kai         uu-long        hauux man  guu                               dhes.''

Chicken  the big one  that     is      a maker of possession  me

"那只大的鸡是我的，That big chicken is mine."

==== 5.    Adjectives for describing the forms/attributes of things, and those for describing the status of actions or emotions, can be doubled, but the adjective has to be monosyllabic.When the adjectives are doubled, the degree of the adjective increases, e.g., ====

''veengs    kaeu kaeu''

shirt/top  white  white

"白白的衣服，white clothes"

''dzuuns  dzuuns buuen''

quick      quick    come

"快快来，come quickly"

''dais   dais   fei''

slow  slow  walk

"慢慢走，walk slowly" (When the Hlai people are saying farewell (bye), "dais dais fei" is the phrase they say to each other.)

Two different adjectives can be doubled like AABB, e.g.,

''Blongs  dhes baen  baen  hleny hleny.''

House    my    new   new   good  good.

"我的房子又新又好，My house is new and good."

''Zuu  hom         hwous     neix  peek  peek long  long.''

One  classifier  mountain this   high   high  big    big

"这一座山又高又大，This mountain is tall and big."

Two different adjectives also can be positioned in an ABAB pattern, e.g.,

''Guen  neix peek  tauus  peek  tauus.''

Road   this   high  short  high   short

"这条路高高低低，This road is rough/bumpy."

''Na        fei      aus    uty       aus     uty.''

He/she  walk  swing swing  swing  swing

"他踉踉跄跄地走着，He is walking tipsy (unsteady like a drunk)."

''Zuu  dhaenx    guen   neix  muety   toei  muety    toei.''

One  classifier  road  this   straight  flat  straight  flat

"这一条路平平直直，This road is straight and smooth."

Also, some [[Monosyllable|monosyllabic]] adjectives express an increasing degree by the adding of a prefix, which combines the initial consonant of that adjective with a vowel like "i" or "u"; and the tone of the prefix is the first tone, e.g.,

''li-        loek''

prefix  dark

"黑漆漆，pitch-dark"

''ri-       raeux''

prefix  sparse

"稀疏，sparse"

''gu-     goeks''

prefix  concave

"黑漆漆，full of bumps and holes/uneven"

''ghu-   ghaeu''

prefix  clear

"清澈，clear"

==== 6.    Some adjectives can have a duplicated suffix tagged on to the ends, which cannot exist independently, to intensify the description, e.g., ====

''kaeu- laepplaepp''

white  something looks bright

"亮晶晶，something is so white as to be bright"

''loek-  tingting''

black  something looks dark

"黑漆漆，something is so black as to be dark"

''tax   fous-qiettqiett''

rice  hot   something looks hot

"饭热乎乎，the hot rice"

==== 7.     The word "enyx" is used to describe something small, and can either be placed before the noun or after; either way the emphasis is on the latter word, e.g., ====
{| class="wikitable" width="425"
| width="201" valign="top" |"enyx" + noun
| width="224" valign="top" |noun + "enyx"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |enyx   '''hla''',

small  fish

"小鱼，small fish"
| width="224" valign="top" |hla   '''enyx''',

fish  small

"小的鱼，small fish"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |enyx   '''kai''',

small  chicken

"小鸡，chick"
| width="224" valign="top" |kai         '''enyx''',

chicken  small

"小的鸡，chick"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |enyx   '''dziengx''',

small  finger

"小指，small finger"
| width="224" valign="top" |dziengx  '''enyx''',

finger      small

"小的手指，small finger"
|}
 
The word "long" is used to describe something big or large, and can either be placed before the noun or after; either way the emphasis is on the former word, e.g., 
{| class="wikitable" width="425"
| width="201" valign="top" |"long" + noun
| width="224" valign="top" |noun + "long"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |'''long'''  duis,

big     water buffalo

"大的水牛，big buffalo"
| width="224" valign="top" |'''duis'''               long,

water buffalo  big

"大水牛，big buffalo"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |'''long'''  hwoet,

big     wind

"大的风，big wind."
| width="224" valign="top" |'''hwoet'''  long,

wind     big

"大风，big wind"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |'''long'''  cai,

big    tree

"大的树，big tree"
| width="224" valign="top" |'''cai'''  long,

tree  big

"大树，big tree"
|}
 
Another way to express something big or large is to add the prefix "''bais-''" to nouns related to objects/things; but, if the prefix "''bais-''" is added to nouns related to mankind/persons, it becomes an indicator of gender, e.g., 
{| class="wikitable" width="425"
| width="201" valign="top" |bais-fun,

big   rain

"大雨，heavy rain"
| width="224" valign="top" |bais-kuuengxcai,

big   tree

"大树，big tree"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |bais-qien,

big   stone

"大石头，big stone"
| width="224" valign="top" |bais-coem,

big   fruit

"大果子，big fruit"
|-
| width="201" valign="top" |bais-duis,

big   water buffalo

"母水牛，female buffalo"
| width="224" valign="top" |bais-kai,

big   chicken

"母鸡，hen"
|}
 
Nouns that have the prefix "bais-" added on to them can be modified by the word "long" to increase the degree, e.g.,

''bais-kuuengxcai  long,''

big   tree              big

"很大的树，large tree"

''bais-qien    long,''

big   stone  big

"很大的石头，large stone"

If the speaker intends to increase the degree, the word "dhat" or "dhatdhat" can be added.

===[[Grammatical number|Numbers]]===
{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=77–87}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=107–09}} 

Numbers in Hlai language, including [[Cardinal numbers (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]], [[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]], and numbers of approximation, usually act as subjects, predicate, or objects in a sentence. When numbers are used with [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], together they become a phrase that can be an attribute to modify the [[noun phrase]].

====[[Cardinal numeral|Cardinal numbers]]====
=====Basic numbers units=====
* 【''ceuus''/''zeuus''/''zuu''，一】: one (in some case, the word "''lax''" also mean the digit—"one")
* 【''hlaus''，二】: two
* 【''fus''，三】: three
* 【''caus''，四】: four
* 【''ba''，五】: five
* 【''dom''，六】: six
* 【''tou''，七】: seven
* 【''ghou''，八】: eight
* 【''fauus''，九】: nine
* 【''fuet''，十】: ten
* 【''ghwaen''，百】: hundred
* 【''nguen''，千】: thousand
* 【''vaens''，万】: ten thousand

=====Basic numbers unit combinations=====
* 【''fuet'' ''ceuus''，十一】: eleven
* 【''fuet'' ''hlaus''，十二】: twelve
* 【''hlaus'' ''fuet''，二十】: twenty
* 【''fus'' ''fuet'' ''ba''，三十五】: thirty five
* 【''lax'' ''ghwaen'' ''hlaus'' ''fuet''，一百二十】: one hundred twenty
* 【''caus'' ''nguen'' ''uengx'' ''ceuus''，四千零一】: four thousand zero one (4,001)
* 【''zuu'' ''vaens''，一万】: ten thousand

===== C. Cardinal numbers by themselves usually cannot modify nouns, but need to be placed before a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] to modify the noun that goes after the classifier, e.g., =====

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一只鸡
|zuu lang kai
|one CLF chicken
|"one chicken"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 十个人
|fuet zuen aeu
|ten CLF person/man
|"ten people"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 两千棵树
|hlaus nguen kuuengx cai
|two thousand CLF tree
|"two thousands tree"}}

However, in relation to dates (like year, month, day), numbers can modify these types of nouns without classifiers.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你们住在北京一年了
|Meuuda doengs dhuus Bhakgengs zuu boux hei lo.
|you live in Beijing one year pass accent
|"You have lived in Beijing for a year."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他两天不上山砍柴了
|Na hlaus hwan da kaen hwous geek guns lo.
|he two day not {go up} mountain search firewood accent
|"These past two days he has not gone up to the mountain to look for firewood."}}

===== D. Cardinal numbers cannot be doubled, except for with "''nguen''" and "''vaens''"; when their pattern is AABB, and the resulting phrase means a number of great amount, e.g., =====

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 有千千万万的人来
|Zaux nguen nguen vaens vaens aeu buuen.
|have thousand thousand {ten thousand} {ten thousand} man come
|"There are thousands of people coming."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 千千万万的人都想去北京
|Nguen nguen vaens vaens aeu ngan qieng hei Bhakgengs.
|thousand thousand {ten thousand} {ten thousand} man also/all desire go Beijing.
|"Thousands of people want to go to Beijing."}}

Sometimes, the words "''nguen''" and "''vaens''" combine with "''jieng''" or "''zuu''" to form an ABAC phrase to modify a noun, synonymous in meaning to the AABB pattern, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 有成千成万的人去
|Zaux jieng nguen jieng vaens aeu hei.
|have form thousand form {ten thousand} man go
|"There are thousands of people going."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 千千万万的人都盼望天下雨
|Zuu nguen zuu vaens aeu ngan qieng fas fun.
|one thousand one {ten thousand} man all desire sky rain
|"Thousands of people look forward to the rain."}}

===== E. There are four words ("''zuu''", "''ceuus/zeuus''", and "''lax''") that can represent the place value of "one", but each word has its own usage. =====

First, when Hlai people count, they will say, "''ceuus/zeuus, hlaus, fus, caus''…(1, 2, 3, 4…)", they won't use "''zuu''" or "''lax''" for one.

The word "''zuu''" needs to go with a classifier to modify a noun.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一只水牛
|zuu lang duis
|one CLF {water buffalo}
|"one water buffalo"}}

The digit 1, when it is either in the 100's, 1,000's, 10,000's, 100,000's.... place of a number, the word "zuu" should be used for 1, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百
|zuu ghwaen
|one hundred
|"one hundred"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一千
|zuu nguen
|one thousand
|"one thousand"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一万
|zuu vaens
|one {ten thousand}
|"ten thousand"}}

The digit 1, when it is either in the 10's or 1's place of a number, the word "ceuus/zeuus" should be used for 1, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 十一
|fuet ceuus/zeuus
|ten one
|"eleven (11)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百一十
|zuu ghwaen ceuus/zeuus fuet
|one hundred one ten
|"one hundred and ten (110)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一万一千零一十一
|zuu vaens zuu nguen ceuus/zeuus fuet ceuus/zeuus
|one {ten hundred} one thousand one ten one
|"Eleven thousand and eleven (11,011)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百零一
|zuu ghwaen uengx ceuus/zeuus
|one hundred and one
|"one hundred and one (101)"}}

However, if the number is used with a classifier, then the word "zuu" should be used, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一千零一个
|zuu nguen uengx zuu hom
|one thousand and one CLF
|"one thousand and one (objects)"}}

The word "''lax''" cannot be used with a classifier. The word "''lax''" only can be used in the first digit when the number is bigger than ten. However, if the number is multiple of 10 like 100, 1000, 10000...etc., the word "''zuu''" should be used, instead of "''lax''". e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一十一
|lax fuet ceuus/zeuus ({{=}} fuet ceuus/zeuus)
|one ten one {{=}} ten one
|"eleven (11)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百一十一
|lax ghwaen ceuus/zeuus fuet ceuus/zeuus 
|one hundred one ten one
|"one hundred and eleven (111)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一千六百
|lax nguen dom ghwaen ({{=}} zuu nguen dom ghwaen)
|one thousand six hundred {{=}} one thousand six hundred
|"one thousand six hundred (1600)"}}

===== F. There are two words ("''fuet''" and "''bun''") that are used for the place value of "ten," but each word has its usage. =====

First, "''fuet''" is used for the number ten when counting. 
 
"''Bun''" does not need to go with a classifier to modify a noun. However, if the word "''bun''" does go with a classifier to modify a noun, the only two classifiers that can be used are "''hom''" and "lang"; but when "lang" is used with people, "''bun''" cannot be used.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 二十块钱
|hlaus bun hom gan ({{=}} hlaus bun gan)
|two ten CLF money {{=}} two ten money
|"twenty dollars"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 三十只鸡
|fus bun lang kai ({{=}} fus bun kai)
|three ten CLF chicken {{=}} three ten chicken
|"thirty chickens"}}

"''Fuet''" needs to go with a classifier to modify a noun, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 十只水牛
|fuet lang duis
|ten CLF {water buffalo}
|"ten water buffalo"}}

However, "fuet" can be placed in front of nouns, which are also classifiers, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 五十岁
|ba fuet boux
|five ten CLF/year
|"fifty years"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 三十岁
|fus fuet waeu
|three ten CLF/bowl
|"thirty bowls"}}

=====Zero=====
In Hlai language, there is no word for the number "zero"; some areas adopted the [[Loanword|loan word]] "lengs" (零，zero), e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百零五
|zuu ghwaen lengs ba
|one hundred zero five
|"one hundred and five (105)"}}

However, the number "zero" can be represented by the conjunction "uengx" or "loms", e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 一百零二（个）
|zuu ghwaen uengx hlaus (hom)
|one hundred and two (CLF)
|"one hundred and two (102)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 三千零二十（个）
|fus nguen loms hlaus fuet (hom)
|three thousand again two ten (CLF)
|"three thousand and twenty (3020)"}}

===== H. In Hlai language, there are two rules to construct numbers =====

(1) when any single digit from 1 to 9 is placed after "''fuet''", "''ghwaen''", "''nguen''", or "''vaens''", the relation between the digit and the word is addition, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 十一
|fuet ceuus (= fuet + ceuus)
|ten one
|"eleven (11)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 十二
|fuet hlaus (= fuet + hlaus)
|ten two
|"twelve (12)"}}

(2) when any single digit from 1 to 9 is placed before "''fuet''", "''ghwaen''", "''nguen''", or "''vaens''", the relation between the digit and the word is multiplication, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 三十
|fus fuet (= fus X fuet)
|three ten
|"thirty (30)"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 二百
|hlaus ghwaen (= hlaus X ghwaen)
|two hundred
|"two hundred (200)"}}

====[[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|Ordinal numbers]]====
A.    In Hlai language, the word "''ghwous''" (头，head) or "''ceuus''" (一，one) means "first", and the word "''cuty''" (尾，tail) means "last"; for all numbers in between first and last, the word "''tom''" (中间，middle) is used.

''hluuek-ghwous-ghwa''

child     head      to plant

"老大（长子），the first born child (usually, it means "son")"

''hluuek-tom''

child    middle

"老二，老三…，the child(ren) in the middle"

''hluuek-cuty''

child     tail

"老幺，the youngest child"

When one's gender is needed, the word "''pasmaen''" (男人，man) or "''baiskaux''" (女人，woman) can be added, e.g.,

''hluuek-pasmaen-ghwous-ghwa    = hluuek-ghwous-ghwa''

child     man        head      to plant = child     head     to plant

"长子，the first born son"

''<br />hluuek-baiskaux-ghwous-ghwa   =  hluuek-baiskaux-long''

child     woman    head     to plant = child     woman    big

"大女儿，the first born daughter"

Usually "''ghwous''" indicates the oldest male; "''long''" the oldest female, like "''kauuslong''" (大姐, oldest sister), "''zoulong''" (大嫂，wife of oldest brother).

Moreover, the prefix "''pas-''" (男性，man) or "''bais''-" (女性，woman) can be added to the words "''tom''" and "''cuty''", to indicate gender, e.g.,

''pas-            tom''

male prefix  middle

"次子，the son in the middle"

''<br />bais-              cuty''

female prefix  tail

"幺女，the youngest daughter"

When ordinal numbers apply to things, usually the phrase is constructed by "ghwous" + "zuu" + a proper classifier to represent the first one, e.g.,

''ghwous  zuu  kuuengx''

head       one  classifier for tree

"头一棵，the first (tree)"

To present the last one, usually the phrase is constructed with the words "''baiscuty''" + "''zuu''" + a proper classifier, e.g.,

''baiscuty  zuu  hom''

last/tail    one   classifier

"最后一个，the last (one)"

To present the middle one(s), usually the phrase is constructed with the words "baistom" + "zuu" + a proper classifier, e.g.,

''baistom  zuu lang''

middle    one  classifier

"第二，或第三…，the 2nd, or 3rd…"

=====Counting with ordinal numbers=====

Usually, any accuracy in communication is done with loan words from Chinese, e.g.,

* 【''dhoeis''-''iet''，第一】: first
* 【''dhoeis-dzis''，第二】: second
* 【''dhoeis-das''，第三】: third
* 【''dhoeis-dis''，第四】: fourth
* 【''dhoeis-ngau''，第五】: fifth
* 【''dhoeis-laekk''，第六】: sixth
* 【''dhoeis-qiet''，第七】: seventh
* 【''dhoeis-bhoeix''，第八】: eighth
* 【''dhoeis-gaeus''，第九】: ninth
* 【''dhoeis-dapp''，第十】: tenth

''dhoeis-iet  dus''

first            group

"第一组，the first group"

''dhoeis-bhoeix  dhuix''

eighth               team

"第八队，the eighth team"

''dhoeis-dzis  bhaenx''

second         class

"第二班，the second class"

===== C.  For counting the passage of years, months, days, or time =====

In Hlai culture, people use a way similar to the [[Chinese zodiac|Chinese Zodiac]] to count years, and even days, e.g.,

* year
** 【''boux-diu''，鼠年】: the year of the mouse
** 【''boux-duis''，牛年】: the year of the buffalo
** 【''boux-cauus''，鱼年】: the year of the fish
** 【''boux-bous''，兔年】: the year of the rabbit
** 【''boux-dang''，龙年】: the year of the dragon
** 【''boux-zan''，虫年】: the year of the insect
** 【''boux-ngas''，马年】: the year of the horse
** 【''boux-mat''，人年】: the year of the man
** 【''boux-nok''，猴年】: the year of the monkey
** 【''boux-kai''，鸡年】: the year of the chicken
** 【''boux-tety/hwanba''，狗年】: the year of the dog
** 【''boux-bou''，猪年】: the year of the pig
* day
** 【''hwan-diu''，鼠日】: the day of the mouse
** 【''hwan-duis''，牛日】: the day of the buffalo
** 【''hwan-cauus''，鱼日】: the day of the fish
** 【''hwan-bous''，兔日】: the day of the rabbit
** 【''hwan-dang''，龙日】: the day of the dragon
** 【''hwan-zan''，虫日】: the day of the insect
** 【''hwan-ngas''，马日】: the day of the horse
** 【''hwan-mat''，人日】: the day of the man
** 【''hwan-nok''，猴日】: the day of the monkey
** 【''hwan-kai''，鸡日】: the day of the chicken
** 【''hwan-tety/hwanba''，狗日】: the day of the dog
** 【''hwan-bou''，猪日】: the day of the pig

For counting months, in Hlai culture, there are two kinds of calendar: one is following the Han's [[solar calendar]], e.g.,

# 【''zuu-nyaen-baen''，一月、正月】: January
# 【''hlaus-nyaen''，二月】: February
# 【''fus-nyaen''，三月】: March
# 【''caus-nyaen''，四月】: April
# 【''ba-nyaen''，五月】: May
# 【''dom-nyaen''，六月】: June
# 【''tou-nyaen''，七月】: July
# 【''ghou-nyaen''，八月】: August
# 【''fauus-nyaen''，九月】: September
# 【''fuet-nyaen''，十月】: October
# 【''fuetceuus-nyaen''，十一月】: November
# 【''fuethlaus-nyaen''，十二月、腊月】: December

The other is following the Han's [[lunar calendar]], e.g.,

* 【''zuu-hwan-nyaen''，初一】: the first day of a lunar month
* 【''hlaus-hwan-nyaen''，初二】: the second day of a lunar month
* 【''fus-hwan-nyaen''，初三】: the third day of a lunar month
* 【''caus-hwan-nyaen''，初四】: the fourth day of a lunar month
* ..........
* 【''fuetceuus-hwan''，十一日】: the 11th day of a lunar month
* 【''fuetceuus-hwan''，十二日】: the 12th day of a lunar month
* ..........
* 【''hlausfuetceuus-hwan''，二十一日】: the 21st day of a lunar month
* 【''fusfuet-hwan''，三十日】: the 30th day of a lunar month

==== Number of Approximation ====
===== A.   In Hlai language, one way to represent approximate numbers is to place two or three sequential numbers together, e.g., =====

''hlaus  fus    (hom)''

two     three  (classifier)

"两三（个），two or three"

''ba   dom (hom)''

five  six.   (classifier)

"五六（个），five or six"

''hlaus  fus     caus (hom)''

two     three  four  (classifier)

"二三四（个），two, three, or four"

''tou      ghou fauus (hom)''

seven  eight  nine  (classifier)

"七八九（个），seven, eight, or nine"

Usually, the numbers one and two are not put together.

===== B.  Another way to represent approximate numbers is to use the word "''dzaengsloepp''" (大约/大概，probably), e.g., =====

''dzaengsloepp  zaux fuet  dom  hom''

probably         have   ten   six   classifier

"大概有十六个，probably have sixteen (ones)"

''dzaengsloepp  zaux  hlaus  fuet  boux he''

probably          have  two     ten  year   accent

"大概有二十岁，about twenty years old"
 
The word "dzaengsloepp" also can be shortened to "loepp",e.g.,

''loepp       zaux tou      fuet  ceuus kuuengx''

probably  have  seven  ten  one     classifier for tree

"大约有七十一棵，probably have seventy-one (trees)"

===== C.  Another way to represent approximate numbers is to use the word "''dza''" (余，a surplus/more than), e.g., =====

''hlaus  dza       hom''

two     surplus  classifier

"两个多，more than two (less than three)"

''fuet  dza       boux''

ten   surplus  year

"十多年，more than ten years (less than twenty)"

The word "dza" can also be used with "loepp" to represent approximate numbers. The construction is "''loepp''" + ''zaux'' + number + "dza", e.g.,

''Na  loepp      zaux  fuet dza        boux  da  buuen  he.''

he   probably  have ten   surplus  year  not  come   accent

"他大约有十余年没来了，He hasn't come (to this place) for more than ten years."

The word "zaux" in this construction can be omitted, e.g.,

''Zuu  hom         as                  neix  loepp      fuet  dza        gins.''

one  classifier  watermelon  this   probably  ten  surplus  classifier, about 500g

"这个西瓜大约有十多斤，This watermelon is a little more than 10 gins."

===== D.   There are some synonyms, like "''zuugit''", "''zuugitgit''", "''zuugitlaei''", that can be used to represent approximate numbers. These words indicate the uncertainty of a small amount, e.g., =====

''Na  naus        lax   zuugit       vi!''

he   just/only   eat   a little bit accent

"他才吃一点点，He only ate a little bit.)"

''Hou  zaux  zuugitgit.''

I        have  a little bit

"我有一点点，I have a little bit.)"

''bhinx  zuugitlaei''

lack    a little bit

=== The basic rules for [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] in Hlai language{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=88–90}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=114–15}}===

==== 1.    Classifiers cannot be doubled as AA (e.g., lang lang), but can be used in a AB+AB pattern, e.g., ====
''Daty  zuu  kun        zuu   kun        bheny.''

bird   one  classifier  one  classifier  fly

"鸟成群成群地飞，Birds fly in groups."

==== 2.    Classifiers cannot modify [[noun]]s alone; classifiers and [[Grammatical number|numbers]] must be used together to modify nouns, e.g., ====
''Zuu  lang       ba    neix  long  dhat!''

one  classifier  dog  this   big    really/truly

"这只狗真大！This dog is really big!"

==== 3.    Classifiers (for modifying verbs) and numbers must be used together and be placed after the verb as a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]; in some regions, the combination (number+classifier) would be placed before the verb, e.g., ====
''Raux          fus    gaeis     =Fus    gaeis       raux''

read aloud  three classifier= three  classifier read

"读三遍，read three times"

''<br />Taeix  zuu guen     = Zuu  guen     taeix''

hit     one classifier = one  classifier  hit

"打一次，to hit/punch one time"

==== 4.    In some occasions, the combination of numbers and classifiers exists alone, whereby they are not modifying any nouns or verbs, e.g., ====
''Hou  caty zuu  hom,        meuu ngan  caty  zuu hom.''

I        buy  one classifier  you      also  buy   one  classifier

"我买一个，你也买一个，I buy one, and you buy one."

===[[Pronoun]]s===
{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=90–97}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=120–22}}

There are three kinds of pronouns: the [[personal pronoun]], [[Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]], and [[Interrogative word|interrogative pronoun]].

====[[Personal pronoun]]s====

The different usage of "''hou''" and "''dhes''"{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=252–54}}

# The women prefer to use "''hou''" when women talk to women, or women to men. They prefer to use "''hou''" in order to express themselves as a humble woman and to show respect to their listeners.
# When a senior member of the family (an elderly, parents, older brothers or sisters...etc.) is angry with a junior, he/she could choose to use "''hou''" or "''dhes''"; on the contrary, juniors are forbidden to use "dhes" when speaking with the seniors in conversation, or when they are angry at them.
# Among blood relatives, when men speak to women, they use "hou"; when men speak to men, either "''hou''" or "''dhes''" can be used; when juniors speak to a senior, they usually use "''hou''".
# Among in-laws, no matter whether men, women, seniors, or juniors, when they speak to each other, the word "''hou''" is preferable to express politeness.
# Between hosts and guests, no matter the gender or age, the word "''hou''" must be used to express politeness and respect.
# When someone asks a who question, "''Asras…?''" If it is answered with the first personal pronoun, "''hou''" is preferable over "''dhes''", e.g.,
{{interlinear|indent=4|top= Q: 谁在那里？A: 我呀！|Asras dhuus hauux? A: Hou res!|Who is there? A: I accent|Q: Who is there? A: (It's) I.}}
## If someone answers with the word "''dhes''", it expresses his impatient attitude. Usually, it occurs between family members' conversations, e.g.,
{{interlinear|indent=4|top= Q: 谁在那里？A: 我嘛！还有谁？|Q: Asras dhuus hauux? A: Dhes vi! Asras?|Q: Who is there? A: Me accent! Who?|"Q: Who is there? A: (it's) I! Who else?"}}
# When a man sings to a woman to express his love to her, he will definitely use "''hou''"; if he uses "''dhes''", she would think he is not sincere, e.g.,
{{interlinear|indent=4|top= 露脸给我瞧；露眼睛给我见|Tuuen dhang duuengx hou nga; tuuen ca duuengx hou laeis|{Go out} face give me look {go out} eye give me see|"Let me see your face; let me look into your eyes."}}
# When someone speaks rudely, he uses "''dhes''" instead of "''hou''".
# In today's Hlai society, the difference between "''hou''" and "''dhes''" is not so strict. Generally, women mostly use "''hou''"; men usually use "''dhes''". The word "''hou''" expresses politeness and respect to the listener, and the word "''dhes''" is more casual.

P.S. My language consultant said: the word "''kun''" is a simplified form of "''kunaeu''". Usually, in a conversation held between those of the same gender group, "''kun''" is used; in a conversation held between those of different gender groups, "''kunaeu''" would be used to show respect. Or, if a conversation were made up of those from both the older and younger generation, the younger generation would need to use "''kunaeu''" to show respect toward the elderly.

Personal pronouns can be both a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and an [[Object (grammar)|object]], e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他打小鸟
|Na taeix hluuek daty.
|he hit child bird
|"He hit the little bird."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 拿木棍打他
|dheuu toencai taeix na
|take stick hit him
|"take a stick to hit him"}}

Personal pronouns can also act as an attribute to indicate the possessive relation, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 咱们按照他的话去做
|Gha vou tun na hei vuek.
|we follow words his to do
|"Let's follow his words to do (it)."}}

[[Reflexive pronoun]]s can be an [[Apposition|appositive]] to another pronoun to emphasize the pronoun, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这是我自己做的
|Neix man hou zuenzauus vuek.
|this is I self do
|"I made it myself."}}

The auxiliary word "''guu''" can be placed before a personal pronoun to indicate the possessive relation. After placing the word "''guu''", the pronoun cannot be a subject, an object, nor an attribute, but only a predicate, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这一只鸡是他的
|Neix zuu lang kai man {guu na.}
|this one CLF chicken is his
|"This chicken is his."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这房子是我的
|Blongs neix man {guu dhes.}
|house this is mine
|"This house is mine."}}

====[[Demonstrative]] pronouns====
* 【''neix''，这】: this; here; so; such
* 【''hauux''，那】: that; there; so; such
* 【''max''，那】: that; there

The word "''neix''" refers to someone, or something, at a close distance; the word "''hauux''" is farther away than the word "neix"; the word "''max''" is even farther. These three words also can be combined to the words "''dhong''" or "''hi''" and become compound words as below,
* 【''dhongneix''，这】: like this
* 【''dhonghauux''，那】: like that
* 【''hineix''，这】: such
* 【''hihauux''，那】: like that

Other demonstrative pronouns are:
* 【''uughwaix''，别的】: other
* 【''ranx''，每】: every

When a demonstrative pronoun acts as a subject, it is placed before the head word, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这是新的衣服
|Neix veengs baen.
|this shirt/top new
|"This (is) a new dress."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 那是大水牛
|Hauux duis long.
|that {water buffalo} big
|"That (is) a big buffalo."}}

When a demonstrative pronoun combines with a number, a classifier, and a noun to form a noun phrase, the demonstrative pronoun acts as an attribute, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 那一棵树好得很
|Hauux zuu kuuengx cai hleny baisias.
|that one CLF tree good very
|"That tree is very good."}}

When a demonstrative pronoun acts as an attribute in a noun phrase, it can be placed either in the beginning or at the end of the noun phrase, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这一只鸡肥
|Neix zuu lang kai ghweis.
|this one CLF chicken fat
|"This chicken is fat."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这一只鸡肥，
|Zuu lang kai neix ghweis.
|one CLF chicken this fat
|"This chicken is fat."}}

If the linking verb is placed between the demonstrative pronoun and the noun, the demonstrative pronoun acts as a subject, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这是两只小鸡，
|Neix man hlaus lang kai enyx.
|this are two CLF chicken little
|"These are two chicks."}}

The words "''neix''", "''hauux''", and "''max''" can be a subject, an attribute, an adverbial, and an object; the word "''uughwaix''" can be a subject, an attribute, and an object; the compound words "''dhongneix''", "''dhonghauux''", "''hineix''", and "''hihauux''" can be a subject, an attribute, an adverbial, and a predicate, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这样做吗？
|Dhongneix vuek yos?
|{like this} do Q
|"Is it done like this?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这样的东西好吗？
|Gong dhongneix hleny yos?
|stuff {like this} good Q
|"Is such a thing as this good?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=别那样说，
|Yous rien dhonghauux.
|don't say {like that}
|"Don't say that."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=你是那样的吗？
|Meuu dhonghauux yos.
|you {like that} Q
|"Are you like that?"}}

There is no [[declension]] in demonstrative pronouns to indicate singular or plural. So, the demonstrative pronouns need to go with the number and classifier, or the word "zuugit" to indicate singular or plural, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=那一群鸟飞了，
|Zuu kun daty hauux bheny he.
|one CLF bird that fly accent
|"The flock of birds (is) flying away."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这些米是谁的？
|Zuugit ghei neix ghei uuras?
|some rice this rice whose
|"Whose rice is this?"}}

When the demonstrative pronoun acts as an attribute, it is usually placed after the head word, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这只虾大
|Buuemx neix long.
|shrimp this big
|"This shrimp is big."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=他拿这么多
|Na qieus hloei neix.
|he take many/much so/such
|"He took so much."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=你要这么少
|Meuu dheuu raux hauux.
|you take/want little/few so/such
|"You took/want so little."}}

When the demonstrative pronoun is placed after the [[personal pronoun]], or the [[Interrogative Pronoun|interrogative pronoun]], the demonstrative pronoun loses its meaning, and becomes an empty word that functions as an emphasis to make it sound fluent, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=你要拿什么东西？
|Meuu neix kweis dheuu gong meshes?
|you {empty word} want take stuff what
|"What are you going to take?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=谁找我？
|Uuras hauux gongx hou?
|who {empty word} {look for} me
|"Who is looking for me?"}}

The demonstrative pronoun "ranx" is only placed before the classifier, and can be doubled for emphasis, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=每个人吃一个
|Ranx zuen lax zuu hom.
|every CLF eat one CLF
|"Everyone eats one."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=每一个人都吃一个
|Ranx ranx zuen uuaeu ruus lax zuu hom.
|every every CLF man all eat one CLF
|"Everyone eats one."}}

The demonstrative pronoun "uughwaix" can be an attribute and an object, e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=别的东西
|gong uughwaix
|stuff other
|"other stuff"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=别人（他人，不相干的人）
|aeu uughwaix
|man other
|"other's"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=有别的没有？
|Zaux uughwaix cas da?
|have other or not
|"Do (you) have (any) other stuff?"}}

====Interrogative pronouns ====
* 【''ras''，哪，如何】: Where? Which? How?
* 【''uuras''/''asras''，谁】: Who?
* 【''dhongras''，怎样】: How?
* 【''qiras''，何时】: When? What time?
* 【''hloeiras''，多少】: How much? How many?

|"Who do you see?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=他来谁的家？
|Na buuen blongs uuras?
|he come house who?
|"Whose house is he coming to?"}}

Just like personal pronouns, when the auxiliary word "guu" isplaced before an interrogative pronoun, it indicates a possessive relation, and the interrogative pronoun cannot be a subject, an object, nor an attribute, but only a predicate, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=那黄牛是谁的？
|Nyiu max man {guu uuras}?
|cow that is whose?
|"Whose cow is that?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这衣服是谁的？
|Veengs neix man {guu uuras}?
|shirt/top this is whose?
|"Whose shirt/top is this?"}}

The interrogative word "meshes" cannot be a subject, only an attribute or an object, e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=什么东西最好？
|Gong meshes vaeu hleny?
|stuff what most good
|"What is the best stuff?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=他要拿什么？
|Na kweis dheuu meshes?
|he want take what
|"What does he want to take?"}}

The interrogative word "ras" cannot be a subject, only an attribute, an adverbial or an object., e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=他在哪里？
|Na dhuus ras?
|he exist where?
|"Where is he?"}}

When the word "ras" acts as an attribute, it is usually used with a number and clasiifier, and is placed before a noun, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=哪一个房子最大？
|Ras zuu hom blongs vaeu long?
|which one CLF house most big
|"Which house is the biggest one?"}}

When the word "ras" acts as an adverb, it is usually placed after the adjective, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这果子有多大？
|Coem neix long ras?
|fruit this big how
|"How big is this fruit?"}}

The interrogative word "dhongras" usually acts as an [[adverbial]], and is most often is placed before a verb, but sometimes it can be placed after a verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=怎么吃也吃不完，
|Dhongras lax ngan da bhaeis.
|How eat also not finish

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这山栏地怎样种？

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=你有多少，我要多少，
|Meuu zaux hloeiras, hou dheuu hloeiras.
|you have {how many} I take {how many}
|"However many you have, I will take them."}}

===Adverbs===
{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=97–101}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=129–31}}

====Negation ====
*【''da''，不】: not
*【''yous''，不要，别】: Do not
* others

These adverbs modify verbs or adjectives, and usually are placed before the verbs or adjectives, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这东西坏了，别吃！
|Gong neix reek he, '''yous''' lax.
|stuff this bad accent don't eat
|"This stuff (is) bad, don't eat (it)!"}}

When the adverb "da" modifies verbs or adjectives, and "zo", an accentuated [[Emphatic pronoun|emphatic]] particle, is placed at the end of the sentence, "da" means "not yet", e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他不来

When the adverb "da" is placed at the end of a sentence, then the word "da" signals a question, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你有球吗？
|Meuu zaux kius '''da'''?
|you have ball Q
|"Do you have a ball?"}}

====Degree====
* 【''veau''，最】: for expressing superlative degree
* 【''duix''，最】: for expressing superlative degree (this is a loan word)
* 【''zangs''，太】: too
* 【''nguenxges''，更加】: more, even more (this is a loan word)
* 【''loeppvaix''，恰恰，相当】: just right, just enough, exactly

|top= 最坏
|'''vaeu''' reek
|most bad
|"worst"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 最美丽

|too hot
|"too hot"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 更好
|'''nguenxges''' hleny
|even good
|"even better"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 恰恰好
|'''loeppvaix''' hleny
|exactly good
|"just right"}}

But, the adverbs "dhat" and "baisias" are placed after the adjectives. These two words also can modify verbs, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 很冷
|kaeix '''dhat'''
|cold very
|"very cold"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 非常快
|dzuuns '''baisias'''
|quick {very much}
|"very quick"}}

To increase the degree of something, two different adverbs can modify the same term, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 快极了
|'''vaeu''' dzuuns '''baisias'''
|most quick {very much}
|"Very, very (extremely) quick"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他非常穷
|Na '''vaeu''' vaet '''baisias'''
|he/she most poor {very much}
|"He is very, very (extremely) poor."}}

The word "dhat" can be doubled to increase the degree, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这件衣服非常好，
|Veengs neix hleny '''dhatdhat'''.
|shirt/top this good {very much}
|"This shirt/top is a very good one."}}

====Scope, extent, or range====
* 【''ruus''，都】: all
* 【''ngan''，也，都】: also, all
* 【''nyoengx''，仅，只】: only
* 【''mans''，仅，只】: only
* others

These adverbs are usually placed before the verbs to modify them, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 大家都相信，
|Uengxtoengs '''ruus''' qim.
|everyone all believe
|"Everyone believes that."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我也做，
|Hou '''ngan''' vuek.
|I also do
|"I also do (that)."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他只要一个果子，
|Na '''mans/nyoengx''' dheuu zuu hom coem.
|he/she only take one CLF fruit
|"He only took one fruit."}}

These adverbs "mans" and "nyoengx" can be linked together to emphasize the voice, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他只有一个孩子，
|Na '''mans-nyoengx''' zaux zuu zuen hluuek.
|he/she only have one CLF child
|"He has only one child."}}

====Timing====

* 【''kuenx''，先】: earlier, before, first, in advance
* 【''naeus''，刚】: just, a moment ago
* 【''faets''，正在】: in process
* 【''dhom''，还】: still, yet
* 【''fan''，就，便】: then (This word is usually used in a narrative when describing something.)
* 【''goms''，就】: then (This word is usually used in a quote.)
* others

These adverbs cannot be doubled for intensity, except for the adverb "naeus", e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他刚刚来，
|Na {'''naeus naeus'''} buuen.
|he/she just come
|"He has just come."}}

Adverbs for indicating timing usually modify verbs, and are placed before the verbal phrase, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他刚从家里出去，
|Na '''naeus''' hei tuuen blongs.
|he/she just {go out} from house
|"He's just gone out of the house."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他还没去呢，
|Na '''dhom''' da hei zo.
|he/she still not go EMPH
|"He hasn't gone yet."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:

|top= 你来到这里了，就别再回去了，
|meuu buuen dhaens neix '''goms''' bhaeisyous hei beuu.

|"(Since) You came here, don't go back."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你先说，
|Meuu '''kuenx''' rien.
|you first say
|"You speak first."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你先说，
|Meuu rien '''kuenx'''.
|you say first
|"You speak first."}}

====Duplication or continuation ====
* 【''loms''，又，再，还】: also, again,
* 【''uuloms''，又，再，还】: also, again,
* 【''toengs''，互相】: each other
* others

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你再说一遍，
|Meuu '''loms''' rien zuu gaeis.
|you again say one CLF
|"Repeat that once more."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他们互相打架了，
|Kun taeix '''toengs''' he.
|they fight {each other} EMPH
|"They fought each other."}}

The verb being modified by the adverb "toengs" can be modified by other adverbs, which are placed before the verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你们别互相打架了！
|Meuuda yous taeix '''toengs''' as!
|{you.PL} don't fight {each other} EMPH
|"Don't fight each other!"}}

|Baiscai long neix '''oms''' caeu.
|big tree big such but break
|"Such a big tree, but (it) was broken!"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 人家到底为什么骂你？
|Aeu '''naus''' cas meuu vuek meshes
|others emphasis scold you do what{{=}}why?
|"Why do people scold you?"}}

A more unusual placement of these adverbs is at the beginning of a sentence, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 原来他在那里！
|'''Cuuslax''' na dhuus max.
|so he/she exist/in there
|"So, there he is!"}}

===Prepositions===
{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=137–39}}

====Place, direction, or time ====

===== A. The prepositional phrase, which is constructed by the prepositions below, usually is placed after a verb, and acts as an adverbial to modify the verb. =====
* 【''dhuus''，在】: in, at, on
* 【''tuuen''，从】: from
* 【''ueks''，里】: inside

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你住在那里哟！

|top= 你从哪里来？
|Meuu buuen '''tuuen''' ras?
|You come from where?

However, as more and more young generation Li have mingled with Han culture, they have gradually adopted Chinese grammar, and have placed the prepositional phrase before the verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你住在那里哟！
|Meuu '''dhuus''' max doengs hyo!
|You in there live accent
|"You live there!"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你从哪里来？

|walk along ridge field
|"walk along the ridge of the field"}}

===Prepositions related to object ===

==== A. The prepositional phrase, which is constructed by the prepositions below, usually is placed after verbs, and acts as an adverbial to modify the verb. ====
* 【''toep''，连】: even
* 【''koms''，连】: even
* 【''goem''，对，和，与】: to, with
* 【''ku''，对，和】: to

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他穷得连睡的地方也没有
|Na vaet '''toep/koms''' fok gaux ngan wenysnaeis.
|He poor even place {to sleep} also no

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 和他对唱山歌
|vuektun '''goem''' na.

|"Sing a song with him."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 母亲对他说
|Baisdza rien '''ku''' na.
|Mother say to him
|"(His) mother told him."}}

However, because of the influence of Chinese grammar, the "ku" prepositional phrase can also be placed before the verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 母亲对他说
|Baisdza '''ku''' na rien.
|Mother to him say
|"(His) mother told him."}}

==== B. When a prepositional phrase, constructed by the preposition "dhuas," modifies an adjective as a complement, it indicates a comparison. ====
* 【''dhuas''，过】: than

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 幺妹子比姐姐们漂亮
|Ghueng baiscuty hlenymuuen '''dhuas''' kun hluuekkauus.
|{Younger sister} youngest beautiful than plural {older sister}
|"The youngest sister is more beautiful than her older sisters."}}

==== C. The prepositional phrase, which is constructed by the prepositions below, usually is placed before the verb, and acts as an adverbial to modify the verb. ====

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他跟小孩打架
|Na '''uengx''' enyxlauux taeixtoengs.
|He with kids fight
|"He fought with the child(ren)."}}

However, the prepositional phrase using "uengx" can also be placed after the verb, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他来跟小弟玩
|Na buuen doengs '''uengx''' hluuekpasghueng.
|He come play with {young brother}
|"He came to play with (his) little brother."}}

==== 5. Prepositions related to agent ====

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他被狗咬了
|Na '''ia''' ba gaenys he!

===Auxiliary words===
{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=110–13}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2006|pp=151–52}}

====Structural auxiliary words====
There are three words in the category of structural auxiliary words: "guu", "uu-", and "dhaens"

When the word "guu" is placed before a noun or a pronoun to indicate subordination, this combination functions as a possessive phrase, and can only be in the predicate of the sentence, e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这东西是你的
|Gong neix '''guu''' meuu.
|Stuff this {belong to} you
|"This is yours."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 那房子是我的
|Blongs hauux man '''guu''' dhes.
|House that is {belong to} me
|"That house is mine."}}

However, the word "guu" can be omitted, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这件衣服是她的
|Veengs neix veengs na.
|shirt/top this shirt/top he/she
|"This dress is hers."}}

The auxiliary prefix "uu-" can be added to some verbs or adjectives. After adding this prefix, the nominalized verb or adjective can be a subject, object, or an attribute, but cannot be a predicate, e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 红的好
|'''Uu'''-ghaens hleny.
|AUX-red good
|"The red one is good."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我吃小的
|Hou lax '''uu'''-enyx.
|I eat {the small one}
|"I will eat the small one."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这是吃的东西
|Neix man gong '''uu'''-lax.
|This is stuff AUX-eat
|"This is something that can be eaten."}}

Another structural auxiliary word is "dhaens". It is usually placed after a verb or an adjective, and is followed by a complement that indicates the result or degree of the action/situation, e.g.,
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 冷得发抖
|Kaeix '''dhaens''' nyan.
|Cold {so as to} shiver
|"It is so cold as to (make one) shiver."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 酸得流口水
|Fas '''dhaens''' maeu nomshloei.
|Sour {so as to} drool saliva
|"It is so sour as to (make one) drool."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他胖得难走路
|Na ghweis '''dhaens''' gax fei guen.
|He fat {so as to} cannot walk road
|"He is so fat that it's hard (for him) to walk."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他去到河边就回来
|Na hei '''dhaens''' ngaeix noms fan beuuluung.
|He go arrive edge/bank river then {come back}
|"He went to the riverside and later he will come back."}}

====Past tense auxiliary word====
The word "dhuas" is placed after a verb to indicate an action has already happened, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我去过北京
|Hou hei '''dhuas''' Bhakgengs.
|I go AUX Beijing
|"I have been to Beijing."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你见过他吗？
|Meuu laeis '''dhuas''' na cuus da?
|You see AUX he or not?
|"Have you seen him?"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我想过这个问题
|Hou qieng '''dhuas''' muixdhoeis neix.
|I think AUX question this
|"I thought about this question."}}

====Acting-receiving auxiliary words====
Both the auxiliary words "lax" and "dheuu" are often used to indicate the relationship of acting and receiving between an agent and a patient.

The original meaning of the word "lax" is "to eat", however, the meaning changes when it acts as an auxiliary word; the word "lax" is usually placed after the person-object in double-object sentences, even when the thing-object is absent.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我哥哥给他一只狗
|Pashlaus hou duuengx na '''lax''' zuu lang ba.
|{Older brother} my give him AUX one CLF dog
|"My brother gave him a dog."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 你教我黎话
|Meuu dun hou '''lax''' tun Hlai.
|You teach me AUX language Li
|"You teach me the Li's language."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我讲给他
|Hou rien duuengx na '''lax'''.
|I say to him AUX
|"I spoke to him."}}

The original meaning of the word "dheuu" is "to take", however, the meaning changes when it acts as an auxiliary word, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 他给我一个水果
|Na duuengx hou '''dheuu''' zuu hom coem.
|He give me AUX one CLF fruit
|"He gave me one fruit."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这一个椰子给你
|Zuu hom zuuyunx neix duuengx meuu '''dheuu'''.
|One CLF coconut this give you AUX
|"This coconut is for you."}}

Generally, the word "lax" and "dheuu" are exchangeable.

==[[Phrase]]s in [[Hlai languages|Hlai language]]==

=== The Construction of Phrases and their basic rules in Hlai language{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=121–30}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2009|pp=22–30}}===

There are five kinds of phrases: the coordinative phrases, the attribute phrases, the verb-object phrases, the complement phrases, and the subject-predicate phrases.

==== 1. Coordinative phrases ====
The method used to coordinate equivalent elements in a coordinative phrase is to use conjunctions, but another method is not to use conjunctions. The nouns and pronouns sometimes use the conjunctions, sometimes they do not, e.g.,

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|父 母
|bais pas
|mother father
|"parents"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|你 和 他
|meuu ku/uengx na
|you and he/she
|"you and he/she"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|鸡 和 鸭
|kai ku/uengx eps
|chicken and duck
|"chicken and duck"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|马 和 水牛
|gas ku/uengx duis
|horse and {water buffalo}
|"horse and water buffalo"}}

Usually, the verbs and adjectives need conjunctions,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 又打又骂
|taeix loms cas
|beat and scold
|"beat and scold"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 又酸又辣
|fas hloeis ghety
|sour and hot
|"sour and hot"}}

However, when the verbs and adjectives are doubled, there is no need for conjunctions, e.g.,

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|往 往 返 返
|hei hei luueng luueng
|go go back back
|"go back and forth"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|进 进 出 出
|Hluet hluet tuuen tuuen 
|{come in} {come in} {go out} {go out}
|"come in and out"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|红 红 绿 绿
|kiu kiu ghaens ghaens 
|green green red red
|"green and red"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|这样 那样
|dhongneix dhonghauux

<br />d.   Verb (the head word) + noun (complement)

In this case, the verb must be an intransitive verb, and the phrase can be an independent clause or a predicate.

''<br />bhaeis   hlaeux duis                he.''

already  die       water buffalo  accent

"牛已经死了，The water buffalo already died."

===== B.  Adjective-complement phrase =====
The adjective is the head word, and the complement can be a verb, an adjective, or a number with a classifier. The complement indicates the result of the head word, so usually the auxiliary word "dhaens" is placed between the complement and the head word.

high   half       head

"高一半头，a half-head taller"

d.   Adjective (the head word) + noun (complement)

big   wind    accent

"风大啊！The wind (is) strong!"

''<br />Cok  bok        dhat  lo！''

far  road   very  accent

"路远极了！The road (is) so far! (the meaning is the destination is so far away)"

==== 5.   Subject-predicate phrases ====

This kind of phrase is constructed by the subject and the predicate; usually, the subject is a noun or a pronoun, and the predicate is a verb or an adjective.

''Wenysnaeis  aeu      rien  na  reek.''

no                people  say   he bad

"没有人说他坏，No one said he (is) bad."

''<br />Uengxtoengs  ruus  rien  gong  neix fas.''

everyone         all     say   stuff    this   sour

"大家都说这东西酸，Everyone (all) says this stuff (is) sour."

bird    fly        accent

"鸟飞了，Birds have flown (away)."

''<br />Na  buuen  lo.''

he   come    accent

"他来了，He has come."

The construction of the subject-predicate phrase is the same as the attribute phrase.Usually, if there is an element, like an accent, an adverb, or a noun, that is either placed after or before the phrase, then it is a subject-predicate phrase. See the chart below:

=== Subjects ===
The subject is placed before the predicate; and either the nouns, pronouns, numbers, or phrases can be the subject.

=== Predicates ===
The predicate is placed after the subject to provide information about the subject. Usually, verbs or adjectives are the predicate; however, nouns, pronouns, and  phrases can also be the predicate.

====Passive voice====
In the examples above, the subjects are the actors who act out the actions; however, the subjects can also receive the actions, which is called passive voice. Auxiliary words like "ia" or "ghoems" can be used to denote passive voice, e.g.,
 
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 鸡被狐狸咬了
|Kai          ghoems  dauxmuty gaeny  bhe.
|Chicken  by           fox             bite      accent
|"A chicken was bit by a fox."}}
 
{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 那村子被火烧了
|Bhous  hauux ghoems  fei   cuis  lo.
|Village  that      by           fire burn  accent
|"That village was burned by fire."}}

=== Objects ===
An object follows a verb. However, if the sentence is passive voice, the object can be placed before the verb phrase. Usually, a noun, pronoun or phrase can act as an object; sometimes, a number or verb can also be a subject, e.g.,

==== Double objects (with giving-receiving relation) ====
The construction is Verb + person-object + lax/dheuu + thing-object, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 母亲给她一条裙子
|Baisdza duuengx na lax zuu ruet riens.
|Mother give her {auxiliary word} one CL skirt
|"Mother gave her a skirt."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我教你黎话
|Hou dun meuu lax tun Hlai.
|I teach you {auxiliary word} language Li
|"I teach you the Li lauguage."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 哥哥给弟弟一个荔枝
|Pashlaus duuengx pasghueng dheuu zuu hom zuucoeis.
|{older brother} give {younger brother} auxiliary one CL litchi
|"The older brother gave (his) younger brother a litchi (a kind of fruit)."}}

The auxiliary word "lax" can be replaced by the verb "duuengx" (给, give), then the construction becomes Verb + thing-object + duuengx + person-object, and the objects generally cannot be omitted, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 我买龙眼给你
|Hou caty coembhans duuengx meuu.
|I buy {longan (fruit)} give you
|"I bought [[longan]] (to) give to you."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 母亲挑水给弟弟
|Baisdza caep noms duuengx pasghueng.
|Mother carry water give {younger brother}
|"The mother carried water (to) give to the younger brother."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 姐姐煮饭给妹妹
|Hluuekkauus roengx tax duuengx baisghueng.
|{Older sister} cook rice give {younger sister}
|"The older sister cooked rice (to) give to the younger sister."}}

Sometimes, the verb "duuengx" (给, for) can be placed both before the thing-object and the person-object, then the sentence construction becomes Verb + duuengx + thing-object + duuengx + person-object, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=他给我衣服
|Na duuengx veengs duuengx hou.
|He give shirt/top give me
|"He gave a shirt to me."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=父亲不给我糖
|Pasdza da duuengx nomstaengs duuengx dhes.
|Father not give sugar give me
|"(My) Father did not give me sugar."}}

When both speaker and listener are clear what the thing-object is, or the subject itself is the given thing, the thing-object can be omitted, but the auxiliary needs to be kept, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=你给他
|Meuu duuengx na dheuu.
|You give him {auxiliary word}
|"You give it to him."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这把小刀给你
|Zuu pienx enyx gas neix duuengx meuu lax.
|One CL small knife this give you {auxiliary word}
|"This small knife (was) given (to) you."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top=这只鸡给你
|Zuu lang kai neix duuengx meuu lax.
|One CL chicken this give you {auxiliary word}
|"This chicken (was) given (to) you."}}

==== Double objects (without giving-receiving relation) ====
Although some verbs in double-object sentences do not imply the giving-receiving relation, the auxiliary word "lax", which indicates that the subject is "helping" the person-object, is still needed. e.g.,

''Hou  reengs meuu  lax.''

I        move    you    auxiliary word (help)

"我帮你搬，I will help you (to) move."

''Meuu  laix   na    lax.''

You     plow  him auxiliary word (help)

"你帮他犁田，You help him (to) plow."

''Baisdza  caep  hluuekbaiskaux  lax.''

Mother    carry   daughter            auxiliary word (help)

"母亲帮女儿挑，A mother helps her daughter carry (the stuff)."

The auxiliary word "lax" can be followed by another object, e.g.,

''Taeix   dhes lax                            tax.''

Put      me    auxiliary word (help)  rice

"帮我打饭，Please help get me (some) rice."

''Hou  caty  meuu lax                            bheuucai.''

I        buy   you   auxiliary word (help) vegetable

"我帮你买菜，I'll help you buy (some) vegetables."

''Na  rien  na kueng  poengs  meuu lax                             ceengcai.''

He  say he  would  water    you    auxiliary word (help)   flower

"他说他会帮你给花浇水，He said he would help you water the flowers."

==== Complement ====
There are three kinds of complements: sequential, directional, and quantitative complements. A complement goes after the verb or the adjective, in order to explain the sequence, degree, direction, or amount of the action. Usually, the verb, adjective, number, or phrase acts as a complement. Generally, a complement is placed after a verb, but if an object follows that verb, then the sequential complement and quantitative complement have to be placed after that object; the directional complement can either be placed after or before that object, e.g.,

===== A.   Sequential complement =====
''Dzax    ghoems taeix  hlaeux  bhe.''

Snake  by           hit      die      accent

"蛇被打死了，The snake was beaten to death by (someone)."

''<br />Hou  bhaeis  lax   kuuem   he.''

I        already  eat  full         accent

"我已经吃饱了，I have already eaten (rice) and am full."

''<br />Na  lax tax   kuuem  he.''

He  eat  rice full        accent

"他吃饱饭了，He ate and is full."

If the sequential complement is a phrase, the prepositional word "dhaens" is needed to be placed before the phrase, e.g.,

''Na  gwaeng dhaens        tuuen   nomswoms.''

He  pull         preposition go out  sweat

"他拉到出汗，He pulled until he sweat."

''<br />Duis                ghoux  dhaens       ngaeix         noms  hauux.''

Water buffalo  run       preposition  edge/bank river    that

"水牛跑到那河边，The water buffalo ran to the bank of that river."

''<br />Veengs    neix baen  dhaens        asras       ruus qieng  cat.''

shirt/top   this   new  preposition  whoever  also  want   wear

"这衣服新到谁都想穿，This shirt is so new that everyone wants to wear it."

===== B.  Directional complement =====
The directional complement is constructed by a verb + a directional verb, e.g., 
{| class="wikitable" width="482"
| width="103" valign="top" |fei     buuen

walk  come

走来, walk and come
| width="96" valign="top" |fei     beuu

走下, walk down
| width="90" valign="top" |fei     tuuen

==== 2.   Compound sentences ====
There are two kinds of compound sentences; one is a coordinate compound sentence, the other is a subordinate compound sentence, e.g.,

===== A.   Coordinate compound sentences =====
The linked clauses in a coordinate compound sentence are equivalent. There are three kinds of relationships between linked clauses: parallel, progressive, and optional.

a.   The parallel relationship

Usually, there is no need of conjunctions between clauses.

''Hou  kweis hei  kuishuix,             na kweis  hei  ang.''

I        will      go  have a meeting  he  will     go   field

"她能做衣服做裙子，能耕田种地，She can make shirts and skirts, (she also) can work (in) hilly (and) plain fields."

b.   The progressive relationship

The conjunction words that express a progressive relationship between clauses are "loms" (又, still),"oms" (还, 却, yet),"ruus" (都, all), "koms" (连, even/also), and their similar phrases such as "dacaux…koms/uuloms…"(不但...而且...，not only... but also...), e.g.,

''Fas  bhaeis  cop,  na  '''loms'''  da  beuu.''

Sky  already  late  he   still    not come back

"天已经晚了，他还不回来，It was late, and he still (had) not come back."

I       not only  read    finished,  but also  write finished

"我不仅看完了，而且写完了，Not only did I finish reading, but I also finished writing."

You     say/tell  to him,  or            say/tell  to  me

"你对他说，或者告诉我，You tell him, or tell me."

===== B.  Subordinate compound sentences =====
The linked clauses in a coordinate compound sentence are not equivalent. There are three kinds of relationships between linked clauses: transitional, conditional, and causal.

a.   The transitional relationship

Usually, the first clause is the  subordinate clause, and the latter one is the major clause. The conjunction words that express a transitional relationship are "tom" (但是, but), "oms"  (却, but), and "dagoms"  (不然, otherwise), "tus" (但是, but), e.g.,

''Uupans     hou hei  zok  na,   '''tom'''  na hei  qix.''

Yesterday  I       go  to    him, but    he go   street

"昨天我到他家去，但是他已经上街去了，Yesterday I went to (find) him (at his house), but he had already hit the streets."

Want   learn  then   learn  well,   otherwise go back  home

"要学就真正地学，不然就回家去，(If you) want to learn, then learn (it) well, otherwise, go back home."

b.   The conditional relationship

Usually, the first clause is the subordinate clause indicating the condition, and the latter one is the major clause expressing the consequence. The conjunction words that express a conditional relationship are "laeis" (如果, if), "dalunx" (无论, no matter what), e.g.,

''Dalunx               na  rien dhongras, hou  ngan hei.''

no matter what  he  say how,          I       also   go

"不管他怎样说，我都去，No matter what he says, I'll also go."

''<br />Laeis  na  da  buuen, dhes  fan   hei gongx  na.''

If         he  not come,  I        then go  find      him

"如果他不来，我就去找他，If he doesn't come, then I'll go find him."

''<br />Laeis  zaux               tax,   hou  goms  lax.''

If         have/there is  rice, I       then    eat

"如果有饭，我就吃，If there is rice, then I (will) eat."

''<br />Laeis  na   euu,   meuu  goms  waeix ku  hou  bas.''

If         he  agree, you     then    tell      to  me   accent

"如果他答应，你就告诉我吧，If he agrees, then (you) tell me."

Sometimes, the conditional sentence does not need a conjunction word, e.g.,

''Tuuen  kaux      vuek  gong,  nge   zaux  gan       zaux jien.''

Out      strength  do    work,  must  have money  have  money

"努力工作，一定会有金钱，(If you) use strength to work, (you) will have money."

c.    The causal relationship

Usually, the first clause is the major clause indicating the result, and the latter one is the subordinate clause expressing the cause. The conjunction words that express a causal relationship are "hans" (因为, because), "dagoms" (不然, otherwise), e.g.,

''<br />Fas fun  yous  hei,dagoms    ia            cok.''

Sky  rain don't  go  otherwise  gain/get  sickness

"天下雨了，别去，不然要得病，It's raining, don't go, otherwise (you'll) get sick."

''<br />Dhes  da hei,  hans        dhes cok  bhe.''

I         not  go  because  I        sick accent

"我不去，因为我病了，I'm not going because I'm sick."

''<br />Hou beuu           bat   dhoei, hans       tuut   bhaeis.''

I       come back  take rope, because  break  totally

"我回来拿绳子，因为全断了，I came back to take a rope, because (my rope is) totally broken."

Sometimes, the word "hans" also can be used in a conditional clause, e.g.,

''Jieng,     hans                   hloei   ges            fa    ngan duuengx.''

Success,  no matter what  much  price/cost  we also    give

"能成功的话，那么多少钱我们都给，(Achieve) success, no matter how much it costs."

When the loan words "ienxuis…dosdzis"are used to present the cause-result relationship, the causal clause is placed before the result clause, e.g.,

''Ienxuis    boux neix  fas  raenx, dosdzis  daenslieng aiszangs  peek.''

Because  year   this sky  dry,      so          produce      not so      high

"因为今年天旱，所以产量不太高，Because this year it (is) dry, (so) the produce (is) not so much."

===== C.   Compressed compound sentences =====
In view of idea expressed, the compressed sentence is a compound sentence; in view of construction, it is a simple sentence.

Dhes  ghais meuu  vuek  meshes goms  vuek  meshes.

I          tell     you     do     what       then   do     what

== Influence of Chinese grammar{{sfn|Yuan|1994|pp=180–85}}{{sfn|Wen|Wen|2009|pp=47–51}}==
Due to the frequent contacts made between the [[Li people|Li]] (黎族) and the [[Han Chinese|Han]] (汉族) over a relatively lengthy stretch of time, the Hlai language has been influenced by the Chinese language and [[Chinese grammar|its grammar]]. As previously mentioned, the Hlai counting system for dates, ordinal numbers, and measurements have been influenced by Chinese. In this chapter, the Chinese influence in Hlai's [[word order]] of attribute phrases, verb-object-complement phrases, and interrogative sentences is discussed.

=== Attribute phrases ===
Nouns act as head words, and the attribute word is a number. Natively, the number should be placed before the head word. But, due to the Chinese influence, the number can be placed after the head word, e.g.,
{| class="wikitable"
!Original order
!Influenced order
|-
|{{fs interlinear|三 只 野猪|fus lang laty|three CLF boar|"three boars"}}
|{{fs interlinear|野猪 三 只|laty fus lang|boar three CLF|"three boars"}}
|-
|{{fs interlinear|一 个 果子|zuu hom coem|one CLF fruit|"one fruit"}}
|{{fs interlinear|果子 一 个|coem zuu hom|fruit one CLF|"one fruit"}}
|-
|{{fs interlinear|两 条 竹子|hlaus dhanx roenx|two CLF bamboo|"two bamboo"}}
|{{fs interlinear|竹子 两 条|roenx hlaus dhanx|bamboo two CLF|"two bamboo"}}
|}

When nouns act as head words, and the attribute words are demonstrative pronouns and numbers, the number is placed before the head word and the demonstrative pronoun after the head word. But, due to Chinese influence, the word order has become more like the word order in Chinese, e.g.,
{| class="wikitable"
!Original order
!Influenced order
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 这一个枕头|zuu hom ngaen neix|one CLF pillow DEM|"this pillow"}}
|{{fs interlinear| 这 一 个 枕头|neix zuu hom ngaen|DEM one CLF pillow|"this pillow"}}
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 那六件衣服|dom fans veengs hauux|six CLF shirt DEM|"these six shirts"}}
|{{fs interlinear|那 六 件 衣服|hauux dom fans veengs|DEM six CLF shirt|"these six shirts"}}
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 那七棵椰子树|tou kuuengx zuuyunx max|seven CLF coconut DEM|"those seven coconut tree"}}
|{{fs interlinear|那 七 棵 椰子树|max tou kuuengx zuuyunx|DEM seven CLF coconut|"those seven coconut tree"}}
|}

When two nouns are placed together as an attribute phrase, the front noun is the head word, and the back one the attribute word. However, due to Chinese influence, the word order can be changed, but only when applied to loan word attribute phrases, e.g.,
{| class="wikitable"
!Original order
!Influenced order
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 海南省|dengs Haeisnaems|province Hainan|"Hainan province"}}
|{{fs interlinear|海南 省|Haeisnaems dengs|Hainan province|"Hainan province"}}
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 乐东县|gwaeis Lokdhongs|county Ledong|"Ledong county"}}
|{{fs interlinear|乐东 县|Lokdhongs gwaeis|Ledong county|"Ledong county"}}
|-
|{{interlinear|top= 抱由镇|dhiens Bhausdzius|township Baoyou|"Baoyou township"}}
|{{fs interlinear|抱由 镇|Bhausdzius dhiens|Baoyou township|"Baoyou township"}}
|}

Another kind of attribute phrase is where the noun is the head word and the adjective is the attribute word. When the words in the phrase are all loan words, the word order follows the Chinese one, e.g.,

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|新 中国
|dienx Dongxgok
|new China
|"new China"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|新 裙子
|dienx gun
|new skirt
|"new skirt"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|大 救星
|dhuax giuscex
|big savior
|"great savior"}}

However, when the words in the phrase are not all loanwords, the adjective is placed after the noun, e.g.,

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 新中国
|Dongxgok baen
|China new
|"new China"}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 这是新裙子
|neix man gun baen.
|DEM.this is skirt new
|"This is a new skirt."}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|top= 大救星
|giuscex long
|savior big
|"great savior"}}

=== Verb-object-complement phrases ===
When verbs act as head words, the word order is verb-object-complement. But, due to Chinese influence, the word order, verb-complement-object has also been adopted, e.g.,

{| class="wikitable"
!Original order
!Influenced order
|-
| {{interlinear|top=吃完饭|lax tax bhaeis|eat rice finished|"finished eating"}}
| {{fs interlinear|吃 完 饭|lax bhaeis tax|eat finished rice|"finished eating"}}
|-
| {{interlinear|top=做完工|vuek gong bhaeis|do work finished|"finished working"}}
| {{fs interlinear|做 完 工|vuek bhaeis gong|do finished work|"finished working"}}
|-
| {{interlinear|top=吃完酒|lax bhiengx bhaeis|eat {rice wine} finished|"finished drinking"}}
| {{fs interlinear|吃 完 酒|lax bhaeis bhiengx|eat finished {rice wine}|"finished drinking"}}
|}

=== Interrogative sentences ===
The native ways to denote a question in the Hlai language are using interrogative pronouns, interrogative accents, or placing the negation word {{lang|mis|da}} at the end of a sentence. However, due to Chinese influence, a new word order has appeared, which is, verb (head word) + negation + verb, e.g.,

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|你 去 不 去？
|Meuu hei da hei?
|You go NEG go
|"Are you going?"}}

=== The possessive auxiliary word {{lang|mis|gaeis}} ===
The native possessive auxiliary word in Hlai is {{lang|mis|guu}}. In the Chinese language, the possessive auxiliary word is {{lang|zh-Latn|gaeis}}, and both its usage and function have been imputed into the Hlai language, e.g.,

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|北京 的 颐和园
|Bhakgengs gaeis Ihwashueis
|Beijing AUX.POSS {the name of emperor's Summer Palace}
|"Beijing's Summer Palace"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|海南 的 乐东 县
|Haeisnaems gaeis Lokdhongs gwaeis
|Hainan AUX.POSS Ledong township
|"Hainan's Ledong township"}}

{{fs interlinear|number=ex:
|早晨 的 太阳
|gaeusdhom gaeis cahwan
|morning AUX.POSS sun
|"the morning's sun"}}
