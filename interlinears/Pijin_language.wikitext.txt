'''Pijin''' (Solomons Pidgin or Neo-Solomonic) is a [[language]] spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is closely related to [[Tok Pisin]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Bislama]] of [[Vanuatu]]; these might be considered dialects of a single language. It is also related to [[Torres Strait Creole]] of [[Torres Strait]], though more distantly.

In 1999 there were 307,000 second- or third-language speakers with a literacy rate in first language of 60%, a literacy rate in second language of 50%.<ref name="Language of Solomon Islands">{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=pis |url-access=subscription |title=Pijin, A language of Solomon Islands |access-date=12 October 2008 |publisher=Ethnologue |editor=Gordon, Raymond G. Jr |year=2005}}</ref>

== History ==
=== 1800–1860 ===
During the early nineteenth century, an English [[Jargon]], known as [[Beach-la-Mar|Beach-La-Mar]], developed and spread through the Western Pacific as a language used among traders ([[Lingua franca]]) associated with the [[whaling]] industry at the end of the 18th century, the [[sandalwood]] trade of the 1830s, and the ''[[Sea cucumber (food)|bêche-de-mer]]'' trade of the 1850s.<ref name="BeachLaMar">{{cite journal |title=The Jargon of the Western Pacific |pages=295 |journal=Nature |issue=2200 |year=1911 |volume=88  |author=William Churchill | doi= 10.1038/088295a0 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== 1860–1880 ===
Between 1863 and 1906, [[blackbirding]] was used for the [[sugar cane]] plantation labour trade in [[Queensland]], [[Samoa]], [[Fiji]] and [[New Caledonia]]. At the beginning of the trade period, the Australian planters started to recruit in the [[Loyalty Islands]] early 1860s, [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Banks Islands]] around the mid-1860s, [[New Hebrides]] and the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in the early 1870s, and [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]] from 1879 when recruiting became difficult. Around 13,000 Solomon Islanders were taken to Queensland during this labour trade period.<ref name="My nephew is my aunt">{{cite book |title=Features and transformations of kinship terminology in Solomon Islands Pijin'. In Processes of Language Contact: Studies from Australia and the South Pacific |pages=99–122 |author=ed Jeff Siegel |year=2000 |publisher=Fides |location=Montreal}}</ref>

The ([[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]]) pidgin language was used on the plantations and became the lingua franca spoken between Melanesian workers (the Kanakas, as they were called) and European overseers. When Solomon Islanders came back to the Solomons at the end of their contract, or when they were forcefully repatriated at the end of the labour trade period (1904), they brought pidgin to the Solomon Islands. Old people today still remember the stories that were told by the old former Queensland hands many years after their return

=== 1880–1900 ===
Plantation languages continued into the 20th century even though the process of blackbirding had ceased. Due to the changing nature of labour traffic there was a divergence of Samoan plantation Pijin and New Guinea [[Tok Pisin]] and also other plantation Pijin and Oceanic Pijins such as [[Bislama]] and Solomon Pijin.

=== After 1900 ===
In 1901, there were approximately 10,000 Pacific Islanders working in Australia, most in the sugar cane industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales, many working as [[indentured labourers]]. The [[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]], [[Parliament of Australia]] was the facilitation instrument used to deport approximately 7,500 Pacific Islanders.<ref name="hrc">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/forum/Erace/history.html |title=A history of South Sea Islanders in Australia |access-date=12 October 2008 |publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |author1=Tracey Flanagan |author2=Meredith Wilkie |author3=Susanna Iuliano |year=2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807235318/http://humanrights.gov.au///racial_discrimination/forum/Erace/history.html |archive-date=7 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Up until 1911 approximately 30,000 Solomon Islanders were indentured labourers to Queensland, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia.<ref name="maggie">{{cite book |title=The Beginners Pijin Handbook |pages=3 |author=Maggie Wateha'a |publisher=RAMSI |location=Honiara}}</ref> The use of Pijin by churches and missionaries assisted in the spread of Pijin.

With Pax Britannica and the advent of the local plantation system in the Solomon Islands, the use of Pijin was reactivated and the language started to spread in the country.  It also acquired more Solomonic linguistic characteristics.  Throughout the 20th century Pijin kept spreading: historical events such as Maasina Rule and WWII, and social changes such as urbanisation, played a central role in the transformation of the language. It is now the lingua franca of the country, though it has no official status.

=== 2000s ===
Despite being the lingua franca of the Solomon Islands, Pijin remains a spoken language with little to no effort made thus far on the part of the national government toward standardising its orthography and grammar. Efforts at standardisation have been made by Christian Associations such as SITAG. There exists a partial dictionary since 1978 (Simons and Young 1978), a full dictionary of Pijin since 2002 (Jourdan 2002), a spelling list (Beimers 2010) and a complete description of its grammar (Beimers 2009). This being the case Pijin remains a very flexible language where the main focus is on message delivery irrespective of the niceties of formal sentence construction.  A translation of the Bible into pijin also represents a standardisation of some aspects of Pijin.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ringer|first1=David|title=Solomon Islands government celebrates Pijin Bible release|url=http://www.wycliffe.net/Stories/tabid/67/Default.aspx?id=1082&country=BP|access-date=8 October 2014|agency=Wycliffe}}</ref>

=== Variation in pronunciation ===
Several consonant [[phoneme]]s show variation,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Simon |first1=Linda |last2=Young |first2=Hugh |title=Pijin Blong Yumi: A Guide to Solomon Islands Pijin |date=1978 |publisher=Solomon Island Christian Association Publications Group |location=Honiara, Solomon Islands |page=14}}</ref> in part depending on the speaker's personal linguistic background – i.e. the [[Phoneme|phonological profile]] of the  [[Languages of the Solomon Islands|vernacular language(s)]] they speak at home.

Several cases of variation are simply due to the regular [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoicing of voiced consonants at the end of syllables]] (a common alternation in the world's languages)

===Number===
Pijin, like other languages to which it is related, involves a distinction between singular, dual, trial and plural pronouns. Dual forms refer to two people or things, trial forms refer to three and plural forms refer to three or more. Such pronoun forms do not occur in English but are common in South Pacific languages.

===Clusivity===
Pijin pronouns also use different forms to distinguish between inclusive and exclusive pronouns. The inclusive and exclusive features are only realised in the first person dual, trial, and plural pronoun forms. For example, the first-person dual inclusive pronoun, ''iumitufala'', means ‘we’ (you and me, including the listener), and the first-person dual exclusive pronoun, ''mitufala'', means ‘we’ (him/her and me, excluding the listener). This dual inclusive pronoun is used quite frequently in the Solomon Islands. It is used most often in religious sermons when the speaker is referring to a relationship between himself/herself and a specific individual in the audience.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pacific Languages in Education|year=1996|publisher=Bluebird Printery Ltd|location=Suva, Fiji|pages=191–205|author=Ernest W.

== Linguistic topics ==
{{Empty section|date=May 2013}}

== Transitive verb suffix ==
In comparison to their original English forms Pijin transitive verbs have an additional morpheme in the form of a suffix. To the English speaker, these morphemes sound like VERB + 'him' or 'them.' The suffix is realised through the morphemes -m, -im, and -em. For example, the Pijin word for 'love' would be ''lavem''.

== Epenthesis ==
Another linguistic phenomena that occurred in the transitions from English to Solomon Islands' Pijin is the addition of vowels in the interior and final positions of a word. Like most languages in the Solomon Islands consonant clusters and consonant-final words do not occur in Pijin. Therefore, speakers of the language add vowels in between consonants in and word finally to adapt the English forms to Pijin grammar. The selection of the extra vowels is usually made in accordance with vowel harmony rules. For example, the word 'business' ({{IPA|[bɪznɛs]}}) becomes * {{transl|pis|bisinis}} or * {{transl|pis|bisinisi}} (depending on the age and dialect of the Pijin speaker).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jourdan |first=Christine |year=1989 |title=Nativization and anglicization in Solomon Islands Pijin |journal=World Englishes |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1989.tb00432.x}}</ref> "Work" is ''waka''.
