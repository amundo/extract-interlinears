'''Kwaza''' (also written as '''Kwazá''' or '''Koaiá''') is an [[endangered language|endangered]] Amazonian language spoken by the [[Kwaza people]] of [[Brazil]].<ref>[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/kwaza "Introduction: Kwazá."] ''Povos Indígenas no Brasil.'' Retrieved 12 Feb 2012.</ref> Kwaza is an [[unclassified language]]. It has grammatical similarities with neighboring [[Aikanã language|Aikanã]] and [[Kanoê language|Kanoê]], but it's not yet clear if that is due to a genealogical relationship or to contact.<ref name="Voort 2004" />

Little is known about Kwaza people and language due to the minimal historical sources available; if mentioned in reliable documents, it is usually in reference to its neighbors.<ref name="Voort 2004">[Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin ;New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 3.]</ref>  What is known, is that the Kwaza people were at one point a nation of a few thousand people, which could be subdivided into various groups.<ref name="Voort 2004"/>

The Kwaza language is threatened by extinction. In 2004, the language was spoken on a day-to-day basis by just 54 people living in the south of the state of [[Rondônia]], Brazil.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Kwaz%C3%A1|title=Kwazá - Indigenous Peoples in Brazil|website=pib.socioambiental.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref> Of those 54, more than half were children, and half were [[Multilingualism|trilingual]], speaking Kwaza, [[Aikanã language|Aikanã]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and some were [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], also speaking Portuguese.<ref name=":0" /> They live south of the original home of the Kwaza, on the [[Tuba Rao-Latundê]] indigenous reserve.<ref name="Voort 2005">[Voort, Hein van der. 2005.

==Classification==
Van der Voort (2005) observes similarities among Kwaza, [[Kanoê language|Kanoê]], and [[Aikanã language|Aikanã]], but believes the evidence is not strong enough to definitively link the three languages together as part of a single language family. Hence, Kwaza is best considered to be a [[language isolate]].<ref>Van der Voort, Hein. 2005. Kwaza in a comparative perspective. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 71: 365–412.</ref>

== Location ==

[[File:Brazil State Rondonia.svg|thumb|Rondônia is one of the smaller states of Brazil and shares a border with eastern Bolivia.]]

=== Historical ===
The history of the Kwaza people is one marked with tragedy, which may contribute to why their language is endangered. in the 1960s, the Kwaza people lost many of their members due to the opening of the [[BR-364]], an inter-state highway in Brazil connecting the southeast states to the western states.<ref name=":0" /> Today there are only about 40 individuals, Kwaza, Aikanã and [[Latundê|Latunde]] peoples, who have been living together for a number of decades in the south of Rondônia.<ref name=":0" /> These peoples also lived in the state of Rondônia  and were also expelled from the fertile lands that they originally lived on, which may be why they live together now.<ref name=":0" /> The majority of the Kwaza have either been decimated or dispersed, and their culture destroyed by the national society which has been highly influenced by Western states. This may be the biggest conflict that the Kwaza people have faced, thus contributing to the endangerment and possible extinction of their language.

The traditional habitat of the Kwaza was the high forest in the Amazon, living and settling around rivers.<ref name=":0" />

Due to the extremely limited documentation, combined with the semi-nomadic lifestyles of the Kwaza speakers and the lack of permanent settlements from a slash and burn agriculture, the historical location of the people is largely unknown. In addition, disease brought by Western contact and the imposed culture actively worked to destroy the local materials and societies.  However, according to oral tradition and sporadic instances of documentation, the Kwaza lived along the [[São Pedro River (Guandu River)|São Pedro]] and [[Taboca River|Taboca rivers]] in addition to along the headwaters of the [[Pimenta Bueno River|Pimenta Bueno]] River.<ref name="ReferenceA">[Voort, Hein van der. 2005. Kwaza in a comparative perspective. International Journal of American Linguistics 71. 366.]</ref>

[[File:BR-364.jpg|thumb|[[BR-364]] Highway from Vilhelna to Porto Velho]]

Before contact with the "national society", the Kwaza held various rituals and activities.<ref name=":0" /> These included a several month isolation of young girls, [[Human cannibalism|anthropophagy]], and the sport of head-ball.<ref name=":0" /> They decorated their bodies with shells, earrings, teeth, and painted their bodies with various dyes.<ref name=":0" /> Some of the Kwaza still plant bananas, [[Cassava|manioc]], peanuts, yams and tobacco.<ref name=":0" /> They also gather fruits and keep various types of animals such as monkeys, birds, and pigs as pets.<ref name=":0" />

=== Modern Day ===
In the modern day, speakers live on the indigenous reserve of Tubarão - Latundě.  This lies on the headwaters of Apediá or Pimento Bueno River, in the southeast of the federal Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]].  Rondônia is part of the [[Guaporé, Rio Grande do Sul|Guaporé]] region, the most diverse linguistic region of South America.  Over 40 indigenous languages can be found here, including 8 unique macro-families, and possibly 10 isolates.  Kwaza is therefore set in extreme linguistic diversity.  However, like Kwaza, most of the languages here are endangered with extinction and are poorly documented.<ref>Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin ;New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 1.</ref>

==Neighbors, Invaders, and Scientist Interactions==

===Neighbors and Invaders===
The Kwaza people neighbored the [[Mekéns language|Mekens]]/Sakurabiat, the [[Tupari language|Tupari]], Aikanã and the [[Kanoê language|Kanoê]], both with [[unclassified language]]s, the [[Salamai language|Salamai]] of the Monde language family, and various others, several of which have gone extinct.<ref name=":0" /> Despite all the contact that the Kwaza people may have had with other indigenous peoples, Kwaza language not have a great amount of similarities to any other indigenous language.<ref name=":1">Van der Voort, Hein. "Kwaza in a Comparative Perspective." ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 71, no. 4 (2005): 365-412. {{doi|10.1086/501245}}.</ref> In fact, the [[Guaporé, Rio Grande do Sul|Guapore region]] (where the Kwaza people lived), is known as one of the most linguistically diverse regions of South America, with numerous language families represented such as [[Tacana language|Tacana]], [[Tupi language|Tupi]], Pano, as well as ten unclassified languages, one of which is Kwaza.<ref name=":1" />

The most prominent neighbors of Alaina people groups lived along Tanaru tributary, 20&nbsp;km south, but all the groups in the area formed alliances across linguistic borders.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The first contact with Euro-Americans is hypothesized to have been around the mid 16th century from Spanish expeditions.  The middle of the 17th century offered Jesuit missionaries in Northeast Bolivia.  A relationship of avoidance developed between Portuguese and indigenous people, flaring to hostility in cases of contact.<ref>Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin; New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 4.</ref>

The 19th century rubber boom caused non-Indians to settle permanently in Rondônia, and the posture of avoidance and indifference turned into one of enslavement for the Kwaza people.  The effects of this are seen in the turn of the language towards the Euro-Americans.  Increased contact also caused detrimental epidemics among the indigenous populations. Occasionally the native groups believed the cause of the epidemics were instigated by sorcery of other tribes, which caused violent clashes between the groups and further dwindled numbers to the extreme.<ref>Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin ;New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 5.</ref>

When the highway B-364 opened, impoverished Brazilians, logging companies, and cattle ranchers infiltrated the area and forced the indigenous people off the best lands and onto reserves, further encouraging them to let go of their native language. By 2004, the indigenous population barely hits 5,000 out of a total population of 1.5 million.<ref name="ReferenceB">[Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin ;New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 6.]</ref>

==Language==

=== Language Family ===
Kwaza is referred to as an isolate, however, it is truer to refer to it as an unclassified language.<ref name=":2">Van der Voort, Hein. "Kwaza or Koaiá, an unclassified language of Rondônia, Brazil". ''Indigenous Languages of Lowland South America [Indigenous Languages of Latin America]'', 1 (2000), p. 39-52. Leiden: Research School of Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies (CNWS).</ref> Research has not been able to prove Kwaza's connection to any other language, but there have been attempts to identify possible linguistic relationships with unclassified neighboring languages.<ref name=":2" /> Kanoê and Aikanã, neighboring languages of Kwaza, appear to have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s, a trait they share with Kwaza.<ref name="Voort 2005" /> 

Kwaza shares the [[Inclusive language|inclusive]] vs exclusive distinction in subject reference with Tupi languages.<ref name="Voort 2005" /> The most striking evidence of Kwaza possibly being related to languages in the area is [[Lexical semantics|lexical]].<ref name=":2" /> The long history of contact between the peoples of Rondônia has caused cultural similarities and the occurrence of linguistic similarities.<ref name=":2" /> Van der Voort, in a paper submitted to the Leiden Research School, demonstrated similarities between Kwaza, Kanoê, and Aikanã (all three unclassified) with the Tupari Languages [[Akuntsu]], Koaratira and [[Mekéns language|Mekens]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Documentation History ===
Before 1995, data on Kwaza was not properly gathered and analyzed.<ref name="Voort 2005" /> Knowledge on its grammar did not exist in written form.<ref name="Voort 2005" /> Outside of its native speakers, lexical knowledge from early scientists and explorers of the Rondônia  territory did not exist.<ref name="Voort 2005" /> The first documentation of the Kwaza people was made in 1913 by [[Cândido Rondon|Candido Rondon]] because of his expeditions with telegraph lines in areas of Rondônia.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> In the 1930s, the first written sources of Kwaza words were taken by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]], an anthropologist.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Levi-Strauss was on a reconnaissance expedition documented words on standardised enquiry forms developed for this purpose.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> 

The standardised forms used allowed for easy lexical comparisons between different languages explorers encountered.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Levi-Strauss's 1938 glossary is the oldest source of data from Kwaza and is available in van der Voort's book.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The glossary contained fifty-one French words with their equivalent in Kwaza.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> In 1942, Lieutenant Estanislau Zack created a 222-comparative word list of four languages, including Kwaza.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Kwaza was forgotten until Harvey Carlson rediscovered the language in 1984.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The third recorded documentation of Kwaza was taken as an unpublished word-list by Carlson.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> During linguistic fieldwork as an M.A. student from Berkley, he took down fifty Kwaza words, which is available in "A Grammar of Kwaza".<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The present description of Kwaza is the result of Carlson's word list, as he brought the language to the attention of the linguistic world.<ref name="Voort 2004" />

Linguist Hein van der Voort's involvement in the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research|Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research]] (NOW) in 1994 led to the first modern [[grammar]] of Kwaza. In his book "A Grammar of Kwaza", Van der Voort presented the first [[descriptive grammar]] of the language.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The descriptive grammar included phoneme inventory describing the [[oral vowels]], [[nasal vowel]]s, and place of articulation.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Van der Voort provides a complex description of the [[vowel]]s, with descriptions on [[minimal pair]]s, contextual pairs and [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]]. [[Consonant]]s were also recorded with their matching [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcriptions, places of [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]], and [[Classification of languages|classification]].<ref name="Voort 2004" /> He provides an interpretation of [[Glides (linguistics)|glides]], descriptive rules of [[syllable structure]], [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], length, and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Kwaza loan phonology is described with examples. A comprehensive section on [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] of Kwaza is available with information on [[noun phrase]]s, [[verb phrase]]s, types of [[morpheme]]s, and word order.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Van der Voort includes texts of tales translated from Kwaza to English to bring attention to Brazilian indigenous culture in an effort to preserve it.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> These texts include traditional tales, historical personal accounts, modern personal accounts, and translated songs.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The last section of van der Voort's book is a dictionary of Kwaza to English.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Hein van der Voort's work on the language has given the Kwaza the ability to preserve the language through making it available for others to learn, including non-indigenous people.

=== Phonology ===

Kwaza has eight oral and seven nasal vowel [[phoneme]]s, which are all attested in a minimal pair set, despite the rare /œ/ occurrence. The consonant inventory consists of 19 phonemes.<ref name="Voort-2004">Voort, Hein van. ''A Grammar of Kwaza''. Berlin; New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 45.</ref>

==== Parts of Speech ====
Kwaza has four parts of speech: [[Particle (linguistics)|particles]], [[verb]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[noun]]s.<ref name=":2" /> No [[adjective]]s occur in the language.<ref name=":2" /> In Kwaza, the majority of the bound grammatical morphemes are [[suffix]]es.<ref name=":2" /> Kwaza is morphologically complex in its verbs.<ref name=":2" /> Word order is relatively free, but [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] and [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] are more dominant.<ref name=":2" /> In the language, it is mandatory to [[Inflection|inflect]] verbs to express mood and subject person.<ref name=":2" /> First and second person singular are distinguished by subject agreement marking, as are first person inclusive and exclusive, and the second persona plural.<ref name=":2" /> The third person is not pronounced.<ref name=":2" /> There is no difference between third person singular and plural, or between feminine and masculine.<ref name=":2" />

===== Pro-Drop Language =====
Hein van der Voort (2000) categorizes Kwaza as a '[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]' language because subject agreement is obligatory, while [[pronominal]] reference is optional.<ref name=":2" /> Definite argument morphemes can agree with explicit lexical arguments, but overt pronouns have a contrastive effect by emphasizing them.<ref name=":2" />

===== Verb Morphology =====
Verb morphology in Kwaza can express numerous moods.<ref name=":2" /> These moods include [[exhortative]], [[Interrogative word|interrogative]], [[Declarative sentence|declarative]], [[Imperative sentence|imperative]], and negative.<ref name=":2" /> The imperative only happens with second person subjects.<ref name=":2" /> The second person singular usually has no expression.<ref name=":2" /> There are several verbal-final elements in Kwaza, which exist as [[subordinate clause]] mood markers.<ref name=":2" /> In [[adverbial clause]] construction, subordinate clause mood markers are used, for example in concessive and [[conditional clause]]s.<ref name=":2" /> The same [[Object (linguistics)|object]] and [[Subject (linguistics)|subject]] morphemes are used, while the third person is not expressed.<ref name=":2" /> There is also a [[Semantics|semantically]] abstract 'mood' marker used to connect clauses that are both [[Coordinated clause|coordinated]] and subordinated.<ref name=":2" />

===== Verb Derivation =====
Verbal derivation in Kwaza includes [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] and valency change, negation, [[Modality (linguistics)|modality]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]] which are marked with various optional verbal morphemes.<ref name=":2" /> Some modality morphemes, according to van der Voort, could be grammatically related to mood markers.<ref name=":2" /> Verbs can be turned into adverbs or nouns through stem-final nominalizing morphemes.<ref name=":2" /> Kwaza has two subdivisions of derivational morphemes, directional and classifiers.<ref name=":2" /> While verb morphology in Kwaza is complex, nominal morphology is not. Kwaza has no gender or number inflection.<ref name=":2" /> Nouns can have animate object case marking.<ref name=":2" /> They can also have one of the oblique case markers: [[Grammatical case|beneficiary]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Comitative case|comitative]], and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]].<ref name=":2" /> Nouns are turned into verbs through attaching mood marking. As mentioned, Kwaza does not have adjectives.<ref name=":2" />

===== Nouns and Classifiers =====
Attributive modification of nouns occurs by comparing them with other nouns.<ref name=":2" /> Kwaza also has many classifying morphemes that only 'agree' with specific nouns.<ref name=":2" /> Classifiers are used widely.<ref name=":2" /> They can be used in verb stems, attach to [[bare nouns]], and also modify adverbs.<ref name=":2" /> Classifiers are used in the position of nominalizers.<ref name=":2" /> Classifiers in Kwaza support van der Voorts statement of the language being pro-drop as they have functions similar to the functions of verbal agreement morphemes.<ref name=":2" /> These properties of classifiers rely heavily on the environment in which they are used, and according to van der Voort are not as dynamic as the properties of cross-reference morphemes.<ref name=":2" /> In complex nominalized clauses, specific classifiers cannot replace the nominalizer.<ref name=":2" />

==== Morphological Aspect: Morpheme -ry- ====
In the Kwaza language, the morpheme -''ry''- is used to describe a grammatical number for words in contexts where a few of their referents are described or referred to, also known as paucal. In both nouns and verbs of Kwaza, the morpheme -''ry''- is associated with paucal number, but does not occur in word-final position, and is always followed by a nominaliser (formation of a noun from a verb or adjective).<ref>Van Der Voort, Hein. A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin de Gruter, 2004) pg.534</ref>

For example:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|'hai?arakaru ỹnỹ-''''ry'''-hỹ<ref>Hein van der Voort. A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin: De Gruter, 2004) pg. 540</ref>
|Hai?arakaru call-PAU-NOM
|'the people of / called {{transl|xwa|italic=no|Hai?arakaru'}}}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|etohoi-'''ry'''-'rai<ref>Hein van der Voort, A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2004) pg. 540</ref>
|child-PAU-damn
|'those (my, your, his) children'}}

It is also important to note that the paucal morpheme -ry- applies only to humans and animals in Kwaza. For example:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|xo'ro 'ki-ỹ-'''ry'''-hỹ<ref>Van der Voort, Hein. A Grammar of Kwaza. (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2004) pg. 540</ref>
|ant red-ATT-PAU-NOM
|'that (type of) red ant (PL, *SG)'}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|tala-'mɛ-'''ry'''-rai<ref>Hein van der Voort, A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2004) pg.540</ref>
|uncle-ASS-PAU-damn
|'(my) uncles'}}

==== Negation Morpheme -''he''- ====
In Kwaza, the morpheme -''he''- is one of the [[Negation (linguistics)|negation morphemes]], which creates the negative in [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] and propositions when bound together.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> In this negation morpheme, the negative usually comes before the person and mood marking.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> For example:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|awỹi-''''he'''-da-ki ti-hỹ-'re
|see-NEG-1S-DEC what-NOM-INT
|'I haven't seen him, where is he?'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|areta-''''he'''-da-ki
|know-NEG-1S-DEC
|'I don't know'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(3)
|awỹi-'''he'''-ta-ki
|see-NEG-1O-DEC
|'He didn't see me'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

However, if the clause in the sentence is declarative, and there is no clear argument cross-reference, the declarative mood marker is -''tse''. For

example:

{{interlinear|number=(4)
|kẽi?ỹ-'he-'''tse'''
|Smooth-NEG-DEC
|'It isn't smooth'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(5)
|ja-'he-'''tse'''
|eat-NEG-DEC
|'He did not eat'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

====Reduplication====

Reduplication in the language is very common, and occurs in many contexts, some of which include lexical roots, constituent syllables of roots, verbal person inflections and other parts of morphemes.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> In Kwaza, reduplication can also represent a past tense construction, if the person cross-reference morpheme is reduplicated.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> This is particularly interesting since in the Kwaza language, there is zero specific marking of past and present.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> An example of this is shown here:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|kukui'hỹ-da-da-ky-hỹ-ki<ref name="Voort 2004 pg. 390">Hein van der Voort, A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2004) pg. 390</ref>
|ill-1S-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
|'I was ill'}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|'masju kukui'hỹ-da-da-ky-hỹ-ki=da'mỹ-tse<ref name="Voort 2004 pg. 390"/>
|Marcio ill-1S-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC=want-DEC
|'Marcio is going to say he was ill'}}

Whereas something involving pain in the present tense would take this form:

{{interlinear|number=(1)

In these examples, we see the reduplication of the first person singular, which in the language presents a first person past tense state. Another form of reduplication is root reduplication, which occurs with the repetition of the entire root which can occur with repetitive, progressive, durative and intensifying meaning which is attested both with verbal and adverbial roots . For example:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|Hãidi{{=}}hãi'di-tse<ref name="Voort 2004 pg. 560">Hein van der Voort, A Grammar of Kwaza (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2004) pg. 560</ref>
|Drip{{=}}drip-DEC

|hy{{=}}hy 'dwa-ki<ref name="Voort 2004 pg. 560"/>
|go{{=}}go-onto-DEC
|'He is walking (on) the path'}}

There is also another way in the Kwaza language where reduplication occurs to intensify meaning. Repetition of a syllable of the lexical root may also occur with repetitive and intensifying meaning, oftentimes it is the first syllable which is reduplicated:

=== Syllable Structure ===
All syllables in Kwaza are vowel-final and generally adhere to the /(C)V/ syllable structure.  The exceptions occur in glides and glottal stops.  Any syllables that could begin with a vowel instead are preceded by a voiceless glottal stop.<ref>Voort, Hein van. A Grammar of Kwaza. Berlin ;New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2004. Print. 69.</ref>

===Basic Word Classes and Order===
Since the language  is so morphologically complex it is often described as a non-configurational language.  The flexibility in word order is possible due to almost every word in the sentence having case inflection.  However, generally the structures are head-final, with SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) being most common in instances of two over arguments.  Otherwise, both SV and OV occur frequently.<ref>Voort, Hein van der. 2005. Kwaza in a comparative perspective. International Journal of American Linguistics 71. 371-372</ref>

=== Case and Agreement ===
Van der Voort, in his "Grammar of Kwaza", states that in Kwaza, there is no required morphological distinction in how pronouns and nouns function as objects and subjects.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> However, in certain cases, case inflection of nouns occurs.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> There is one case van der Voort describes a syntactic government relation between verb and argument. The suffix -''wã'' conveys this case, which is called the "animate object" case.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Kwaza displays a small number of "oblique" or "local" [[case marker]]s which display semantic relations amongst verbs and possible nominal satellites.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The suffix ''-ko'' expresses "instrumental" case, -''na'' expresses "locative", -''dynỹ'' expresses "comitative" and -''du'' expresses "beneficiary".<ref name="Voort 2004" />

==== Animate Object -''wã'' ====
In some transitive verbs, specific animate non-subjects of verbs are marked by -''wã''.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> -''wã'' is applied under situations not completely understood.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> What is known is - ''wã'' often places stress on the animate non-subjects.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> -''wã'' is necessary for most verbs with animate nouns that have a direct object function:

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|jere'xwa 'kay-ki natau-''''wã'''
|jaguar scratch-DEC Natal-AO 
|'the jaguar scratched Natal' <ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|'ay-hỹ' kay-ki
|that-NOM scratch-DEC
|'that one scratched (him)'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

Other than elucidating which animate argument is the object, -''wã'' also disambiguates the subject from the object.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> It is especially useful when they are both third person arguments:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|wã zjwãu-''''wã''' e'xyi-ki
|bee João-AO sting-DEC
|'a wasp stung João'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|hiri'ni zjwãu-''''wã''' isi'xwe-ki
|shaman João-AO medicate-DEC
|'the shaman is treating João'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

-''wã'' is not always necessary to differentiate between object and subject, because verbal cross-reference obligatorily expresses the subject.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> For first and second person, subject cross-reference is not zero, but it is in third person.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Even though cross-reference agreement is enough to distinguish subjects and objects, -''wã'' is still obligatory in some cases:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|zjwãu-''''wã''' tsa'si-da-ki
|João-AO follow-1S-DEC 
|'I went after João'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|wã si-'<nowiki/>'''wã''' e'xyi-ta-ki
|bee I-AO sting-1O-DEC 
|'(a) wasp stung me'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

Without -''wã'', syntactic ambiguity occurs.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> But in cases with differences in animacy, no semantic-pragmatic ambiguity occurs.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> This can be seen in the following third person examples of an animate subject and inanimate object:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|uru'hu xare'ja-ki au ho-'tε
|vulture search-DEC flesh rotten-NOM
|'the vulture is looking for rotten meat'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

|Zjwãu ywynwỹ-ko'ro to'wε-ki
|João tree-Cl:arm break-DEC
|'João broke a branch off the tree'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

==== Transitivised Verbs ====
When verbs with the [[Transitive verb|transitivising]] morpheme -''ta''- occur with animate objects, they must be marked with -''wã'':<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|zjuze-''''wã''' oja-'ta-da-ki
|José-AO go-TRA-1S-DEC
|'I visited José'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

When the [[causative]] -''dy'' is attached to [[intransitive verb]]s, they are transitivised.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> In these cases only animate objects are marked:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|luzeu-''''wã''' xarere-'dy-da-ki
|Luzeu-AO crazy-CAU-1S-DEC
|'I'm making Luzeu mad' <ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|kudεrε-''''wã''' mãmãñẽ-'dy-da-ki
|Canderé-AO sing-CAU-1S-DEC
|'I made Canderé sing'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

==== Ditransitive Verbs ====
The indirect object is usually marked in common [[ditransitive verb]]s while the animate object is unmarked:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|zjwãu-''''wã''' ãwã'txi-da-ki
|João-AO show-1S-DEC
|'I'm showing it to João'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|zjwãu ãwã'txi-da-ki
|João show-1S-DEC 
|'I'm showing João to him'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

==== Verbs Which Contain Classifiers ====
If transitive verbs with animate objects have classifying morphemes, -''wã'' is also attached.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> This occurs if the classifier added to the verb stem and when it is not:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|luzeu-''''wã''' hãrũ'ro-da-ki
|Luzeu-AO strangle-1S-DEC
|'I strangled Luzeu'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|zjwãu-''''wã''' hado-'ri-da-ki
|João-AO pierce-CL:flat-1S-DEC
|'I pierced João through the chest'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

In Kwaza, objects of transitive verbs are usually case marked because they are of the animate category.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Case marking becomes ungrammatical when they are inanimate.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Case marking is not required to differentiate the object from the subject.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> The subject can be identified through cross-reference marking on the verb.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> This changes if all arguments are in third person, when arguments are in third person there can be ambiguity.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Without case marking, on the basis of syntax alone, there is no way to distinguish third person animate subjects and objects.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> Case marking is obligatory with transitive verbs have arguments that are the same in person and animacy. -wã- is has two functions: it marks objecthood and animacy.<ref name="Voort 2004" />

==== Locative -''na'' ====
In Kwaza, the case ending -''na'' expresses the sense of "in".<ref name="Voort 2004" /> -''na'' can be used as a general marked to express several locational senses such as: "under, from, into", etc.<ref name="Voort 2004" /> -''na'' is often seen with verbs that have a directional suffix:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

|Chupinguaia-LOC arrive.there-1S-DEC yesterday
|'I arrived there in Chupinguaia yesterday'<ref name="Voort 2004" />}}

==== Instrumental -''ko'' ====
''-ko'' is used to mark nouns that function as an instrumental argument verbs:<ref name="Voort 2004" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|prego-'<nowiki/>'''ko'''<nowiki/>'twe-ki lo'te
