The {{Nihongo|'''Ryukyuan languages'''|琉球語派|Ryūkyū-goha|also {{Nihongo2|琉球諸語}}, ''Ryūkyū-shogo'' or {{Nihongo2|島言葉}} in Ryukyuan, ''Shima kutuba'', [[Literal translation|literally]] "Island Speech"}}, also '''Lewchewan''' or '''Luchuan''' ({{IPAc-en|l|u:|'|tS|u:|@|n}}), are the indigenous languages of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], the southernmost part of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. Along with the [[Japanese language]], they make up the [[Japonic language family]].

The languages are not [[mutually intelligible]] with each other. It is not known how many speakers of these languages remain, but [[language shift]] towards the use of [[Standard Japanese]] and dialects like [[Okinawan Japanese]] has resulted in these languages becoming [[endangered language|endangered]]; [[UNESCO]] labels four of the languages "definitely endangered" and two others "severely endangered".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1975.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|publisher=Unesco.org|access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref>

==Overview==
Phonologically, the Ryukyuan languages have some cross-linguistically unusual features. Southern Ryukyuan languages have a number of [[syllabic consonant]]s, including unvoiced syllabic fricatives (e.g. Ōgami [[Miyako language|Miyako]] {{IPA|/kss/}} {{IPA|[ksː]}} 'breast'). [[Glottal consonant|Glottalized consonants]] are common (e.g. Yuwan [[Amami language|Amami]] {{IPA|/ʔma/}} {{IPA|[ˀma]}} "horse"). Some Ryukyuan languages have phonemic central vowels, e.g. Yuwan Amami {{IPA|/kɨɨ/}} "tree". Ikema Miyako has a [[voiceless nasal]] phoneme {{IPA|/n̥/}}. Many Ryukyuan languages, like Standard Japanese and most Japanese dialects, have contrastive [[pitch accent]].

Ryukyuan languages are generally [[subject-object-verb|SOV]], [[dependent-marking]], modifier-head, [[nominative-accusative]] languages, like the Japanese language. Adjectives are generally [[bound morphemes]], occurring either with noun compounding or using verbalization. Many Ryukyuan languages mark both nominatives and genitives with the same marker. This marker has the unusual feature of changing form depending on an [[Animacy|animacy hierarchy]]. The Ryukyuan languages have [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] markers, which may take different forms depending on the sentential context. Ryukyuan also preserves a special verbal inflection for clauses with focus markers—this unusual feature was also found in [[Old Japanese]], but lost in Modern Japanese.

==Classification and varieties==
The Ryukyuan languages belong to the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] language family, related to the [[Japanese language]].<ref name="sp1" /><ref name="lingarch" /> The Ryukyuan languages are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Japanese—in fact, they are not even mutually intelligible with each other—and thus are usually considered separate languages.<ref name="sp1" /> However, for socio-political and ideological reasons, they have often been classified within Japan as dialects of Japanese.<ref name="sp1" /> Since the beginning of [[World War II]], most mainland Japanese have regarded the Ryukyuan languages as a dialect or group of dialects of Japanese.

The Okinawan language is only 71% lexically similar to, or cognate with, standard Japanese. Even the southernmost Japanese dialect ([[Kagoshima dialect]]) is only 72% cognate with the northernmost Ryukyuan language (Amami). The Kagoshima dialect of Japanese, however, is 80% lexically similar to Standard Japanese.<ref>沖縄語辞典 (''Okinawan dictionary''). "前書き" (''Preface''). 国立国語研究所 1998</ref> There is general agreement among linguistics experts that Ryukyuan varieties can be divided into six languages, conservatively,<ref>言語学大辞典セレクション：日本列島の言語 (''Selection from the Encyclopædia of Linguistics: The Languages of the Japanese Archipelago''). "琉球列島の言語" (''The Languages of the Ryukyu Islands''). 三省堂 1997</ref> with dialects unique to islands within each group also sometimes considered languages.

A widely accepted hypothesis among linguists categorizes the Ryukyuan languages into two groups, Northern Ryukyuan (Amami–Okinawa) and Southern Ryukyuan (Miyako–Yaeyama).<ref name="lingarch">{{Harvcoltxt|Pellard|2015}}</ref><ref name="sp2" /> Many speakers of the Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni languages may also be familiar with Okinawan since Okinawan has the most speakers and once acted as the regional standard. Speakers of Yonaguni are also likely to know the Yaeyama language due to its proximity. Since Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama, and Yonaguni are less urbanized than the Okinawan mainland, their languages are not declining as quickly as that of Okinawa proper, and some children continue to be brought up in these languages.

Each Ryukyuan language is generally unintelligible to others in the same family. There is wide diversity among them. For example, Yonaguni has only three vowels, whereas varieties of Amami may have up to seven, excluding length distinctions. The table below illustrates the different phrases used in each language for "thank you" and "welcome", with standard Japanese provided for comparison.

There is no census data for the Ryukyuan languages, and the number of speakers is unknown.<ref name="sp2">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=2}}</ref> As of 2005, the total population of the Ryukyu region was 1,452,288, but fluent speakers are restricted to the older generation, generally in their 50s or older, and thus the true number of Ryukyuan speakers should be much lower.<ref name="sp2" />

The six Ryukyuan languages are listed in the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. UNESCO said all Ryukyuan languages are on course for extinction by 2050.<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Heinrich |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/08/25/voices/use-lose-theres-stake-language-reviving-ryukyuan-tongues/ |title=Use them or lose them: There's more at stake than language in reviving Ryukyuan tongues |publisher=The Japan Times |access-date=2019-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107141707/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/08/25/voices/use-lose-theres-stake-language-reviving-ryukyuan-tongues/ |archive-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>

Starting in the 1890s, the Japanese government began to suppress the Ryukyuan languages as part of their policy of forced assimilation in the islands.

Children being raised in the Ryukyuan languages are becoming increasingly rare throughout the islands, and usually only occurs when the children are living with their grandparents. The Ryukyuan languages are still used in traditional cultural activities, such as [[Ryukyuan music|folk music]], [[Kumi Odori|folk dance]], [[Ryuka (poetry)|poem]] and folk plays. There has also been a radio news program in the Naha dialect since 1960.<ref>{{cite web|author=沖縄映像センター|url=http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm|title=おきなわBBtv★沖縄の方言ニュース★沖縄の「今」を沖縄の「言葉」で！ラジオ沖縄で好評放送中の「方言ニュース」をブロードバンドでお届けします。|publisher=Okinawabbtv.com|access-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192753/http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm|archive-date=2014-01-02}}</ref>

Circa 2007, in [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], people under the age of 40 have little proficiency in the native [[Okinawan language]].<ref name="s244">{{Harvcoltxt|Sugita|2007|p=244}}</ref> A new [[mixed language]], based on Japanese and Okinawan, has developed, known as "[[Okinawan Japanese]]".<ref name="s245">{{Harvcoltxt|Sugita|2007|p=245}}</ref> Although it has been largely ignored by linguists and language activists, this is the language of choice among the younger generation.<ref name="s245" />

Similarly, the common language now used in everyday conversations in [[Amami Ōshima]] is not the traditional [[Amami language]], but rather a regional variation of Amami-accented Japanese, known as [[Amami Japanese]]. It’s locally known as {{nihongo2|トン普通語}} (''Ton Futsūgo'', literally meaning "potato [i.e. rustic] common language").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synapse.ne.jp/hellokids/sinnantoutuusin/sinnantoutuusin_3.htm |title=島口（奄美の方言）入門その１－あなたもシマンチュに |publisher=Synapse.ne.jp |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Mark|title=Studies of Ryukyu-substrate Japanese|url=https://www.academia.edu/41138518/Studies_of_Ryukyu_substrate_Japanese|journal=Routledge Handbook of Japanese Sociolinguistics|language=en|pages=441}}</ref>

To try to preserve the language, the Okinawan Prefectural government proclaimed on March 31, 2006, that September 18 would be commemorated as {{nihongo3|"Island Languages Day"|[[:ja:しまくとぅばの日|しまくとぅばの日]]|Shimakutuba no Hi}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/reiki/41890101003500000000/41890101003500000000/41890101003500000000.html |title=○しまくとぅばの日に関する条例 |language=ja |publisher=Pref.okinawa.jp |access-date=2014-01-25}}</ref> as the day's numerals in ''[[goroawase]]'' spell out ''ku'' (9), ''tu'' (10), ''ba'' (8); ''kutuba'' is one of the few words common throughout the Ryukyuan languages meaning "word" or "language" (a cognate of the Japanese word {{nihongo3|"word"|言葉|kotoba}}). A similar commemoration is held in the Amami region on February 18 beginning in 2007, proclaimed as {{nihongo3|"Dialect Day"|方言の日|Hōgen no Hi}} by [[Ōshima Subprefecture (Kagoshima)|Ōshima Subprefecture]] in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. Each island has its own name for the event:
*[[Amami Ōshima]]: {{nihongo3||シマユムタの日|Shimayumuta no Hi}} or {{nihongo3||シマクトゥバの日|Shimakutuba no Hi}} (also written {{nihongo2|島口の日}})
*On [[Kikaijima]] it is {{nihongo3||シマユミタの日|Shimayumita no Hi}}
*On [[Tokunoshima]] it is {{nihongo3||シマグチ（島口）の日|Shimaguchi no Hi}} or {{nihongo3||シマユミィタの日|Shimayumiita no Hi}}
*On [[Okinoerabujima]] it is {{nihongo3||島ムニの日|Shimamuni no Hi}}
*On [[Yoronjima]] it is {{nihongo||ユンヌフトゥバの日|Yunnufutuba no Hi}}.
Yoronjima's ''fu'' (2) ''tu'' (10) ''ba'' (8) is the ''goroawase'' source of the February 18 date, much like with Okinawa Prefecture's use of ''kutuba''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/aq01/chiiki/oshima/kyoiku/oosimatikuhougennnohi.html |title=鹿児島県／大島地区「方言の日」 |publisher=Pref.kagoshima.jp |access-date=2014-02-17}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of Ryukyu Islands}}
[[Image:flag of Ryukyu.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]]]
It is generally accepted that the Ryukyu Islands were populated by [[Proto-Japonic]] speakers in the first millennium, and since then relative isolation allowed the Ryukyuan languages to diverge significantly from the varieties of Proto-Japonic spoken in Mainland Japan, which would later be known as [[Old Japanese]]. However, the discoveries of the [[Pinza-Abu Cave Man]], the [[Minatogawa Man]], and the [[Yamashita Cave Man]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Early modern human remains from eastern Asia: the Yamashita-cho 1 immature postcrania  |date=1996-04-30 |doi=10.1006/jhev.1996.0025 |volume=30 |issue=4 |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |pages=299–314|last1=Trinkaus |first1=Erik |last2=Ruff |first2=Christopher B. }}</ref> as well as the [[Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pleistocene human remains from Shiraho-Saonetabaru Cave on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan, and their radiocarbon dating |journal=Anthropological Science |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=173–183 |doi=10.1537/ase.091214 |publisher=Jstage.jst.go.jp |year=2010 |last1=Nakagawa |first1=Ryohei |last2=Doi |first2=Naomi |last3=Nishioka |first3=Yuichiro |last4=Nunami |first4=Shin |last5=Yamauchi |first5=Heizaburo |last6=Fujita |first6=Masaki |last7=Yamazaki |first7=Shinji |last8=Yamamoto |first8=Masaaki |last9=Katagiri |first9=Chiaki |last10=Mukai |first10=Hitoshi |last11=Matsuzaki |first11=Hiroyuki |last12=Gakuhari |first12=Takashi |last13=Takigami |first13=MAI |last14=Yoneda |first14=Minoru |doi-access=free }}</ref> suggest an earlier arrival to the island by modern humans. Some researchers suggest that the Ryukyuan languages are most likely to have evolved from a "pre-Proto-Japonic language" from the Korean peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/181931 |title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages |publisher=Degruyter.com |access-date=2014-03-16|doi=10.1515/9781614511151 |year=2015 |isbn=9781614511151 |editor1-last=Heinrich |editor1-first=Patrick |editor2-last=Miyara |editor2-first=Shinsho |editor3-last=Shimoji |editor3-first=Michinori }}</ref> However, Ryukyuan may have already begun to diverge from Proto-Japonic before this migration, while its speakers still dwelt in [[Mainland Japan|the main islands of Japan]].<ref name="sp2" /> After this initial settlement, there was little contact between the main islands and the Ryukyu Islands for centuries, allowing Ryukyuan and Japanese to diverge as separate linguistic entities from each other.<ref name="sp4">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=4}}</ref> This situation lasted until the [[Kyushu]]-based [[Satsuma Domain]] conquered the Ryukyu Islands in the 17th century.<ref name="sp4" />

Nowadays, in favor of [[multiculturalism]], preserving Ryukyuan languages has become the policy of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa Prefectural government]], as well as the government of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]'s [[Ōshima Subprefecture (Kagoshima)|Ōshima Subprefecture]]. However, the situation is not very optimistic, since the vast majority of Okinawan children are now monolingual in Japanese.

==Geographic distribution==
The Ryukyuan languages are spoken on the [[Ryukyu Islands]], which comprise the southernmost part of the [[Japanese archipelago]]<ref name="sp1">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=1}}</ref> There are four major island groups which make up the Ryukyu Islands: the [[Amami Islands]], the [[Okinawa Islands]], the [[Miyako Islands]], and the [[Yaeyama Islands]].<ref name="sp1" /> The former is in the [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], while the latter three are in the [[Okinawa Prefecture]].<ref name="sp1" />

==Orthography==
[[File:Letter of Kanamaru.jpg|thumb|A letter from King [[Shō En]] to [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] ''[[Glossary of sumo terms#oyakata|oyakata]]'' (1471); an example of written Ryukyuan.]]
{{see also|Okinawan scripts}}
Older Ryukyuan texts are often found on stone inscriptions. ''Tamaudun-no-Hinomon'' ([[:ja:玉陵の碑文|玉陵の碑文]] "Inscription of [[Tamaudun]] tomb") (1501), for example. Within the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], official texts were written in [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]], derived from Japan. However, this was a sharp contrast from Japan at the time, where [[classical Chinese]] writing was mostly used for official texts, only using hiragana for informal ones. Classical Chinese writing was sometimes used in Ryukyu as well, read in ''[[Kanbun|kundoku]]'' (Ryukyuan) or in Chinese. In Ryukyu, [[katakana]] was hardly used.

Historically, official documents in Ryukyuan were primarily written in a form of classical Chinese writing known as [[Kanbun]], while poetry and songs were often written in the Shuri dialect of [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]].

Commoners did not learn kanji. ''[[Omoro Sōshi]]'' (1531–1623), a noted Ryukyuan song collection, was mainly written in hiragana. Other than hiragana, they also used [[Suzhou numerals]] (''sūchūma'' すうちゅうま in Okinawan), derived from China. In [[Yonaguni]] in particular, there was a different writing system, the [[Kaidā glyphs]] (カイダー字 or カイダーディー).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nilab.info/wiki/KaidaJi.html |title=カイダー字: 与那国島にある象形文字。 (KaidaJi - MemoWiki) |publisher=Nilab.info |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecco.m78.com/download/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718081109/http://ecco.m78.com/download/ |archive-date=2006-07-18 }}</ref> Under Japanese influence, all of those numerals became obsolete.

Nowadays, perceived as "dialects", Ryukyuan languages are not often written. When they are, [[Japanese writing system|Japanese characters]] are used in an ''ad hoc'' manner. There are no standard orthographies for the modern languages. Sounds not distinguished in the Japanese writing system, such as [[glottal stop]]s, are not properly written.

Sometimes local [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'yomi'']] are given to kanji, such as ''agari'' (あがり "east") for [[:Wiktionary:東|東]], ''iri'' (いり "west") for [[:Wiktionary:西|西]], thus 西表 is [[Iriomote-jima|Iriomote]].

==Phonology==
Ryukyuan languages often share many phonological features with Japanese, including a voicing opposition for [[obstruent]]s, CV(C) syllable structure, [[Mora (linguistics)|moraic rhythm]], and [[pitch accent]].<ref name="sp4" /> However, many individual Ryukyuan languages diverge significantly from this pan-Japonic base.<ref name="sp4" /> For instance, Ōgami does not have phonemic voicing in obstruents, allows CCVC syllables, and has unusual syllabic consonants such as {{IPA|/kff/}} {{IPA|[kf̩ː]}} "make".<ref name="sp4" />

The Northern Ryukyuan (Amami-Okinawa) languages are notable for having [[glottalic consonant]]s.<ref name="sp5">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=5}}</ref> Phonemically these are analyzed of consisting of a cluster {{IPA|/ʔ/}} + C, where the consonant {{IPA|/ʔ/}} consists of its own mora.<ref name="sp5" /> For instance, in the Amami dialect Yuwan the word {{IPA|/ʔma/}} {{IPA|[ˀma]}} "horse" is bimoraic.<ref name="sp5" /> Tsuken (Central Okinawan) restricts glottalization to glides and the vowels {{IPA|/a i/}}.<ref name="sp5" /> Southern Ryukyuan mostly has little to no glottalization, with some exceptions (e.g. Yonaguni).<ref name="sp5" /> For instance, the Irabu dialect of the Miyako language only allows glottalization with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/c/}}: {{IPA|/ttjaa/}} {{IPA|[ˀtʲaː]}} "then", {{IPA|/ccir/}} {{IPA|[ˀtɕiɭ]}} "pipe".<ref name="sp5" />

Southern Ryukyuan stands out in having a number of syllabic consonants.<ref name="sp5" /> These consonants are contextually nucleic, becoming syllabic when not adjacent to a vowel.<ref name="sp5" /> Examples:

Irabu Miyako:
* {{IPA|/nam/}} {{IPA|[nam]}} "wave"
* {{IPA|/mna/}} {{IPA|[mna]}} "shell"
* {{IPA|/mm/}} {{IPA|[mː]}} "potato"
* {{IPA|/pžtu/}} {{IPA|[ps̩tu]}} "man"
* {{IPA|/prrma/}} {{IPA|[pɭːma]}} "daytime"
Ōgami Miyako
* {{IPA|/us/}} {{IPA|[us]}} "cow"
* {{IPA|/ss/}} {{IPA|[sː]}} "dust"
* {{IPA|/kss/}} {{IPA|[ksː]}} "breast"

Ōgami even shows a three-way length distinction in fricatives, though across a syllable boundary:<ref name="sp118">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=118}}</ref>
* {{IPA|/fɑɑ/}} {{IPA|[fɑː]}} "child"
* {{IPA|/f.fɑ/}} {{IPA|[fːɑ]}} "grass"
* {{IPA|/ff.fɑ/}} {{IPA|[fːːɑ]}} "comb", "top"

Ikema (a Miyako dialect) has a voiceless moraic nasal phoneme {{IPA|/n̥/}}, which always precedes another nasal onset and assimilates its place of articulation to the following nasal.<ref name="sp170">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=170}}</ref>

===Vowels===
Amami has high and mid central vowels.<ref name="sp5" /> Yonaguni only has three contrasting vowels, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}.

===Suprasegmentals===
The Ryukyuan languages operate based on the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]].<ref name="sp6">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=6}}</ref> Most Ryukyuan languages require words to be at least bimoraic, thus for example in Hateruma the underlying noun root {{IPA|/si/}} "hand" becomes {{IPA|/siː/}} when it is an independent noun, though it remains as {{IPA|/si/}} when attached to a clitic, e.g. {{IPA|/si{{=}}nu/}}.<ref name="sp6" /><ref group="nb">In fact, in Irabu Miyako lengthening occurs even before a clitic, thus underlying {{IPA|/ti/}} "hand" becomes {{IPA|/tiː/}} independently and {{IPA|/tiː{{=}}nu/}} with attached clitic. {{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=6}}</ref> However, the [[syllable]] may still sometimes be relevant—for instance, the Ōgami topic marker takes a different form after open syllables with short vowels:<ref name="sp119">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=119}}</ref>
* "staff" {{IPA|/pɑu + {{=}}ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/pɑu{{{=}}iɑ/}}
* "vegetable" {{IPA|/suu + {{=}}ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/suu{{=}}iɑ/}}
* "person" {{IPA|/pstu + {{=}}ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/pstɑ{{=}}ɑ/}}

Ryukyuan languages typically have a [[pitch accent]] system where some mora in a word bears the pitch accent.<ref name="sp7">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=7}}</ref> They commonly either have two or three distinctive types of pitch accent which may be applied.<ref name="sp7" /> The category of [[foot (prosody)|foot]] also has relevance to the accentual systems of some Ryukyuan languages, and some Miyako varieties have a cross-linguistically rare system of tonal foot.<ref name="sp7" /> However, Irabu Miyakoan does not have lexical accent.<ref name="sp7" />

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

The Ryukyuan languages consistently distinguish between the [[word class]]es of nouns and verbs, distinguished by the fact that verbs take [[inflectional morphology]].<ref name="sp9" /> Property-concept (adjectival) words are generally [[bound morphemes]].<ref name="sp10">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=10}}</ref> One strategy they use is compounding with a free-standing noun:<ref name="sp10" />

Ikema:<ref name="sp10" />
{{interlinear|indent=3
|imi- + ffa → imi-ffa
|small {} child {} {small child}|}}
Yuwan:<ref name="sp10" />
{{interlinear|indent=3
|kjura- + ʔkin → kjura-gin
|beautiful {} kimono {} {beautiful kimono}|}}

Compounding is found in both Northern and Southern Ryukyuan, but is mostly absent from Hateruma (Yaeyama).<ref name="sp10" />

Another way property stems are used is by verbalization:<ref name="sp10" />

Yuwan Amami:<ref name="sp52">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=52}}</ref>
{{interlinear|indent=3
|an kɨɨ{{=}}ja taa-sar-oo
|that tree{{=}}TOP tall-{{gcl|VLZ|verbalizer}}-{{gcl|SUPP|suppositional}}
|"That tree is supposed to be tall."}}

Miyako is unique in having stand-alone adjectives.<ref name="sp10" /> These may be formed by reduplication of the root, e.g. Irabu Miyako ''imi-'' "small" → ''imii-imi'' "small (adj.)".<ref name="sp11">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=11}}</ref> They may also be compounded with a grammaticalized noun ''munu'' "thing", e.g. Irabu ''imi-munu'' 'small (thing)'.<ref name="sp10" />

===Syntax===
Ryukyuan languages are generally [[subject-object-verb|SOV]], [[dependent-marking]], modifier-head, [[nominative-accusative]] languages.<ref name="sp8">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=8}}</ref> They are also [[pro-drop]] languages.<ref name="sp8" /> All of these features are shared with the Japanese language.<ref name="sp8" />

In many Ryukyuan languages, the nominative and genitive are marked identically, a system also found, for example, in [[Austronesian languages]].<ref name="sp8" /> However, Ryukyuan has the unusual feature that these markers vary based on an [[animacy hierarchy]].<ref name="sp9">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=9}}</ref> Typically there are two markers of the form ''=ga'' and ''=nu'', which are distinguished based on animacy and definiteness.<ref name="sp9" /> In Yuwan Amami, for instance, the nominative is marked with ''=ga''/''=nu'' and the genitive by ''=ga''/''=nu''/''=Ø'' based on the following hierarchy:<ref name="sp9" />
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Yuwan Amami nominative marker
! human pronouns !! demonstratives !! elder kinship terms !! other nouns
|-
| colspan="3" | ''=ga''
| ''=nu''
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Yuwan Amami genitive marker
! human pronouns, adnominal !! demonstratives !! human names !! elder kinship terms !! other nouns
|-
| colspan="2" | ''=ga''
| colspan="2" | ''=Ø''
| ''=nu''
|}

In the Miyako varieties, the object in a dependent clause of clause-chaining constructions has a special marker, homophonous to a topic marker.<ref name="sp9" /> This might even be interpreted as another function of the topic marker.<ref name="sp9" />

Hateruma Yaeyama stands out in that it is a [[zero-marking language]], where word order rather than case marking is important:<ref name="sp8" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|pïtu{{=}}Ø budur-ja-ta-n
|person{{=}}CORE dance-PRF-PAST-RLS
|"People danced."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|aboa{{=}}Ø ija{{=}}Ø mir-i bir-ja-ta-n
|mother{{=}}ORE father{{=}}CORE look{{=}}MED PROG-PRF-PAST-RLS
|"(My) mother was looking at (my) father."}}

The Ryukyuan languages mark both [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] grammatically.<ref name="sp11" /> The typical form of the topic marker is ={{transl|mis|(j)a}}, or in Southern Ryukyuan ''=ba''; the typical focus marker is ''=du''.<ref name="sp11" /> In some Ryukyuan languages there are many focus markers with different functions; for instance, Irabu has ''=du'' in declarative clauses, ''=ru'' in yes-no interrogative clauses, and ''=ga'' in wh-interrogative clauses.<ref name="sp11" /> The focus markers trigger a special verbal inflection—this typologically unusual focus construction, known as ''kakari-musubi'', was also found in [[Old Japanese]], but has been lost in Modern Japanese.<ref name="sp11" />

Examples from Yuwan Amami:<ref name="sp75">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=75}}</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|kurɨ{{=}}ba{{=}}du jum-ju-i
|this{{=}}ACC-FOC read{{=}}IPFV-NPST
|"(I) read this."}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|uroo kun hon{{=}}ba{{=}}du jum-jur-ui?
|2SG.NHON this book{{=}}ACC-FOC read{{=}}IPFV-FOC.{{gcl|YNQ|yes-no question}}
|"Will you read this book?" (yes-no question)}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|uroo nuu{{=}}ba{{=}}ga jum-jur-u?
|2SG.NHON.TOP what{{=}}ACC-FOC read{{=}}IPFV-FOC.{{gcl|WHQ|wh-question}}
|"What will you read?" (wh-question)}}

While in many Japonic languages this special inflection is often identical to the verbal inflection in relative clauses, in Yuwan Amami is different (the relative inflection is ''-n/-tan'').<ref name="sp75" /> There is some variation among the Ryukyuan languages as to the form of kakari-musubi—for example, in Irabu Miyako a focus marker blocks a specific verb form, rather than triggering a special inflection.<ref name="sp12">{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=12}}</ref>
