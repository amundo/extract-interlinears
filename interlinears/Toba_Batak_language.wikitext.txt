'''Toba Batak''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|b|ə|_|ˈ|b|æ|t|ə|k}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |title=The Linguistics Student's Handbook |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>) is an [[Austronesian language]] spoken in [[North Sumatra]] province in [[Indonesia]]. It is part of a group of languages called "[[Batak languages|Batak]]".

There are approximately 2,000,000 Toba Batak speakers, living to the east, west and south of [[Lake Toba]]. Historically it was written using [[Batak script]], but the [[Latin script]] is now used for most writing.

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Manuscript in Toba-Batak language, central Sumatra, early 1800s - Robert C. Williams Paper Museum - DSC00360.JPG|thumb|right|Manuscript in Toba Batak language, central Sumatra, early 1800s.]]

The name of this [[language]] arises from a rich and complex history of ethnic identity in [[Colonialism|colonial]] and post-colonial [[Indonesia]].  It is a generic name for the common language used by the people of the districts of Toba, Uluan, Humbang, Habinsaran, Samosir, and Silindung, centered upon the Island of [[Sumatra]]; more particularly, at [[Lake Toba]]. Linguistically and culturally these tribes of people are closely related.  Other nearby communities such as  Silalahi and Tongging may also be classified as speakers of Toba Batak.

The term "Toba Batak" is, itself, a derivation of the Toba Batak language.  As such, it is used both as a noun and an adjective; both to describe a language, and also to describe the people who speak the language.

Among the aforementioned districts, Toba is the most densely populated and politically the most prominent district so that "Toba Batak" became a label for all communities speaking a dialect closely akin to the dialect spoken in Toba. In contemporary Indonesia the language is seldom referred to as "Toba Batak" (bahasa Batak Toba), but more commonly and simply as "Batak" (bahasa Batak). The (Toba)-Batak refer to it in their own language as "Hata Batak". This "Batak" language is different from the languages of other "Batak" people that can be divided in speaking a northern Batak dialect (Karo Batak, and Pakpak-Dairi Batak – linguistically this dialect group also includes the culturally very different Alas people), a central Batak dialect (Simalungun) and closely related other southern Batak dialects such as Angkola and Mandailing.

==Background==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een groep kinderen en volwassenen voor Toba Batak huizen TMnr 60004171.jpg|thumb|Toba Batak houses and residents in a photograph by [[Christiaan Benjamin Nieuwenhuis]].]]

There are several dictionaries and grammars for each of the five major dialects of Batak (Angkola-Mandailing, Toba, Simalungun, Pakpak-Dairi, and Karo). Specifically for Toba Batak the most important dictionaries are that of Johannes Warneck (Toba-German) and [[Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk]] (Toba-Dutch). The latter was also involved in translating the Christian [[Bible]] into Toba Batak.

==Syntax==

Toba Batak has [[Verb-initial word order|verb-initial]], VOS word order, as with many [[Austronesian languages]]. In (1), the verb ''mangallang'' 'eat' precedes the object ''kue'' 'cake', and the verb phrase precedes ''dakdanak i'' 'the child'.

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|Mangallang kue dakdanak i.
|AT-eat cake child the
|'The child is eating a cake.' (Silitonga 1973:3)}}

[[Subject-verb-object|SVO word order]] (as in English), however, is also very common (Cole & Hermon 2008). In (2), the subject ''dakdanakon'' 'this child' precedes the verb phrase ''mangatuk biangi'' 'hit the dog'.

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|Dakdanak-on mang-atuk biang-i.
|child-this ACT-hit dog-DEF
|'This child hit the dog.' (Cole & Hermon 2008)}}

[[File:VP movement to derive VOS.png|thumb|left|Figure 1: VP movement to derive VOS word order.]]
Cole and Hermon (2008) claim that VOS order is the result of [[Verb-initial word order#Theoretical approaches|VP-raising]] (specifically, of VoiceP) (Figure 1). Then, the subject may optionally raise over the verb phrase because of information structure. This analysis provides a basis for understanding Austronesian languages that have more fully become SVO (e.g. Indonesian: Chung 2008;<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chung |first=Sandra |date=2008 |title=Indonesian clause structure from an Austronesian perspective |journal=Lingua |volume=118 |issue=10 |pages=1554–1582 |doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2007.08.002}}</ref> Jarai: Jensen 2014<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jensen |first=Joshua |title=Jarai Clauses and Noun Phrases |date=2014 |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |series=Pacific Linguistics}}</ref>).

Like many Austronesian languages (e.g. [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]), DP ''wh''-movement is subject to an extraction restriction (e.g. Rackowski & Richards 2005). The verb in (3a) must agree with ''aha'' 'what' (in (3a): TT or "theme-topic") for it to be extracted in front of the verb. If the verb agrees with the subject, ''si John'' 'John' (in (3b): AT or "actor-topic"), ''aha'' 'what' may not extract.

{{interlinear|number=(3a)
|Aha diida si John?
|what TT.see PM John
|'What did John see?' (Cole & Hermon 2008)}}

{{interlinear|number=(3b)
|*Aha mangida si John?
|what AT.see PM John
|Intended: 'What did John see?' (Schachter 1984:126)}}
