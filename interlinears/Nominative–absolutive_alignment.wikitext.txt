{{linguistic typology topics}}

In [[linguistic typology]], '''nominative–absolutive alignment''' is a type of [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in which the sole [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an [[intransitive verb]] shares some coding properties with the [[agent (linguistics)|agent]] argument of a [[transitive verb]] and other coding properties with the [[patient (linguistics)|patient]] argument ('direct object') of a transitive verb.<ref name="G-CA-2010">{{cite journal |last1=Gildea |first1=Spike |last2=Castro Alves |first2=Flávia de |title=Nominative-absolutive: Counter-universal split ergativity in Jê and Cariban |journal=Typological Studies in Language |date=2010 |volume=89 |pages=159–200 |doi=10.1075/tsl.89.07gil |url=https://amerindias.github.io/curso2015/referencias/gilque10ergativityamazonia.pdf |access-date=8 August 2020}}</ref> It is typically observed in a subset of the clause types of a given language (that is, the languages which have nominative–absolutive clauses also have clauses which show other alignment patterns such as [[nominative–accusative language|nominative-accusative]] and/or [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]]).

The languages for which nominative–absolutive clauses have been described include the [[Cariban languages|Cariban]] languages [[Panare language|Panare]] (future, desiderative, and nonspecific aspect clauses) and [[Kaxuiana language|Katxuyana]] (imperfective clauses), the [[Northern Jê languages|Northern Jê]] languages [[Canela language|Canela]] (evaluative, progressive, continuous, completive, and negated clauses), [[Kĩsêdjê language|Kĩsêdjê]] (progressive, continuous, and completive clauses, as well as future and negated clauses with non-pronominal arguments<ref name="G-CA-2020">{{cite book |last1=Gildea |first1=Spike |last2=Castro Alves |first2=Flávia de |editor-last1=Barðdal |editor-first1=Jóhanna |editor-last2=Gildea |editor-first2=Spike |editor-last3=Luján |editor-first3=Eugenio R. |title=Reconstructing Syntax |publisher=Brill |date=2020 |pages=47–107 |chapter=Reconstructing the Source of Nominative-Absolutive Alignment in Two Amazonian Language Families |chapter-url=https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004392007/BP000010.xml |doi=10.1163/9789004392007_003 |doi-access=free |isbn=978-90-04-39199-4}}</ref>), and [[Apinajé language|Apinajé]] (progressive, continuous, and negated clauses), as well as in the main clauses of the [[Tuparian languages|Tuparian]] languages ([[Makurap language|Makurap]], [[Wayoró language|Wayoró]], [[Tuparí language|Tuparí]], [[Sakurabiat language|Sakurabiat]], and [[Akuntsu language|Akuntsú]]).<ref name="G-CA-2010"/>{{rp|191}}<ref name="CA 2010">{{cite journal |last1=Castro Alves |first1=Flávia de |title=Evolution of Alignment in Timbira |journal=International Journal of American Linguistics |date=October 2010 |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=439–475 |doi=10.1086/658054 |jstor=10.1086/658054|s2cid=224806935 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castro Alves |first1=Flávia de |title=Complement clauses in Canela |journal=Amerindia |date=2011 |volume=35 |page=135-54 |url=https://www.vjf.cnrs.fr/sedyl/amerindia/articles/pdf/A_35_08.pdf}}</ref><ref name="GN-2018"/>{{rp|99}}

==Examples==
===Northern Jê===
In the [[Northern Jê languages|Northern Jê]] language [[Canela language|Canela]], different main clause constructions present different combinations of alignment patterns, including [[Active–stative alignment|split-S]] (default), [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] (recent past), and nominative–absolutive (evaluative, progressive, continuous, completive, and negated clauses). An example of the latter alignment type is given below.<ref name="G-CA-2010"/>{{rp|162}}

;intransitive
{{interlinear|indent=3|IPA2=yes|glossing3=yes|glossing4=yes|glossing=link
|Wa ha iwrỳc naare.

|'I will not grab it.'}}

In nominative–absolutive clauses, the sole [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an [[intransitive verb]] (S) is aligned with the [[Agent (linguistics)|agent]] argument of a [[transitive verb]] (A) in that both may be expressed by [[Nominative case|nominative]] pronouns, such as ''wa'' ‘I.[[Nominative case|NOM]]’ or ''ca'' ‘you.[[Nominative case|NOM]]’ (nouns do not take case inflection in Canela), which occupy the same position in a phrase (in the example above, both precede the [[Irrealis mood|irrealis]] marker ''ha''). At the same time, the sole [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an [[intransitive verb]] (S) is aligned with the [[Patient (linguistics)|patient]] argument ('direct object') of a transitive verb (P) in that both may be indexed on the verb by person prefixes of the [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] series (such as ''i-'' ‘I.[[Absolutive case|ABS]]’ or ''a-'' ‘you.[[Absolutive case|ABS]]’). There are no elements which pattern as ergative or accusative in this type of clauses in Canela.

The historical origin of the nominative–absolutive clauses in Canela has been shown to be a reanalysis of former biclausal constructions (a [[Active–stative alignment|split-S]] matrix clause, headed by the auxiliary, and an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] embedded clause, headed by the lexical verb) as monoclausal, with the loss of the ergative.<ref name="CA 2010"/><ref name="G-CA-2020"/>

===Cariban===
In the [[Cariban language|Cariban]] language [[Panare language|Panare]], future, desiderative, and nonspecific aspect clauses instantiate the nominative–absolutive alignment. An example is given below.<ref name="G-CA-2010"/>{{rp|162}}

{{interlinear|indent=3|IPA2=yes|glossing3=yes|glossing4=yes|glossing=link

|/j-u-tə-sehpa (kəh) kən/

{{interlinear|indent=3|IPA2=yes|glossing3=yes|glossing4=yes|glossing=link
|Yamasejpa (këj) kën.

|p-V a.AUX A
|‘S/he will throw away it/him/her.’}}

In Panare nominative–absolutive clauses, the [[Nominative case|nominative]] and [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] are distinguished as follows. The unmarked [[Nominative case|nominative]] noun or pronoun (if it occurs explicitly) always follows the predicate (''kën'' in the example above), with [[Nominative case|nominative]] agreement in the auxiliary if there is one (''këj'' in the example above). In contrast, the [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] arguments are indexed by means of verbal prefixes (''y-'' in the example above) or by absolutive nouns phrases (not shown above), which are in a [[complimentary distribution]] with the absolutive person prefixes.

===Tuparian===
In the languages of the [[Tuparian languages|Tuparian]] branch, main clauses commonly instantiate the nominative–absolutive pattern. Person prefixes on the verb are [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], i.e., they index the sole [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an [[intransitive verb]] (S) and the [[Patient (linguistics)|patient]] argument ('direct object') of a transitive verb (P). Person pronouns, which follow the verb (either cliticizing to it or not) are [[Nominative case|nominative]]: they may encode the sole [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an [[intransitive verb]] (S) or the [[Agent (linguistics)|agent]] argument of a [[transitive verb]] (A), but not the patient of a transitive verb (P). The example below is from [[Wayoró language|Wayoró]].<ref name="GN-2018">{{cite journal |last1=Galucio |first1=Ana Vilacy |last2=de Souza Nogueira |first2=Antônia Fernanda |title=From object nominalization to object focus: The innovative A-alignment in the Tuparian languages (Tupian family) |journal=Journal of Historical Linguistics |date=20 July 2018 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=95–127 |doi=10.1075/jhl.16025.gal|s2cid=69987541 }}</ref>{{rp|99}}
