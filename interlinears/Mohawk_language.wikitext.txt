'''Mohawk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|ɔː|k}};<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> '''''Kanienʼkéha''''', "[language] of the Flint Place") is an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]] currently spoken by around 3,500 people of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk nation]], located primarily in current or former [[Haudenosaunee]] [[country|territories]], predominately [[Canada]]  (southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]), and to a lesser extent in the [[United States]] (western and northern [[New York (state)|New York]]). The word "Mohawk" is an [[exonym]]. In the Mohawk language, the people say that they are from ''Kanien:ke'' ('Mohawk Country' or "Flint Stone Place") and that they are ''Kanienʼkehá꞉ka'' "People of the Flint Stone Place" or "People of the Flint Nation".<ref name="First3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstvoices.com/sections/Kanienkeha-Mohawk-EN|title=FirstVoices|website=www.firstvoices.com|access-date=Sep 3, 2020}}</ref>

The Mohawks were extremely wealthy traders, as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool-making. Their Algonquian-speaking neighbors (and competitors), the People of ''Muh-heck Heek Ing'' ("food-area place"), a people called by the Dutch "[[Mohicans]]" or "Mahicans", called the People of Ka-nee-en Ka "Maw Unk Lin" or ''Bear People''. The Dutch heard and wrote that as "Mohawks" and so the People of Kan-ee-en Ka are often referred to as ''Mohawks''. The Dutch also referred to the Mohawk as ''Egils'' or ''Maquas''. The [[French people|French]] adapted those terms as ''Aigniers'' or ''Maquis'', or called them by the generic ''Iroquois''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The Mohawks were the largest and most powerful of the original [[Iroquois|Five Nations]], controlling a vast area of land on the eastern frontier of the Iroquois Confederacy. The [[North Country, New York|North Country]] and [[Adirondacks|Adirondack]] region of present-day [[Upstate New York]] would have constituted the greater part of the Mohawk-speaking area lasting until the end of the 18th century.

== Mohawk translations ==
The Mohawk language has various online dictionaries such as ‘FirstVoices’<ref>{{Cite web|title=FirstVoices|url=https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/Kanehsat%C3%A0:ke/Mohawk/Kanien%27k%C3%A9ha%20(Mohawk)%20%5BEng%5D/learn/words|access-date=2020-12-09|website=www.firstvoices.com}}</ref> and ‘Kanien’kéha’<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-11-16|title=Translator • KANIEN'KÉHA LANGUAGE INITIATIVE (Mohawk Dictionary)|url=https://kanienkeha.net/occupation/teiewennanetahkwas/|access-date=2020-12-09|website=Mohawk Dictionary|language=en-GB}}</ref> which offer insight in the translation of Mohawk words. Dictionary are excellent ways at grasping an interpretation of Mohawk translation from one language to another. The problem with Mohawk translation is they are only an interpretation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mohawk Translation Services - English to Mohawk Translations|url=https://www.translation-services-usa.com/languages/mohawk.php|access-date=2020-12-09|website=www.translation-services-usa.com}}</ref> Many of the Mohawk words are expressed as sentiments and do not have direct translation into other language, thus making dictionaries a good but difficult resource. In order to understand Mohawk, it must be learned as a language and culture. Secondary sources<ref name="Thomason, Sarah Grey">{{Cite book|last=Thomason, Sarah Grey|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897001721|title=Endangered languages : an introduction|date=23 April 2015|isbn=978-0-521-68453-8|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|oclc=897001721}}</ref> are excellent ways at understanding a language to keep it revitalized, which is why dictionaries are good for learning, but should not be the basis of learning a language because emotions and culture can be lost in translation.

==Current status==
[[File:Mohawk language stop sign.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mohawk language stop sign.]]
The Mohawk language is currently classified as threatened, and the number of native speakers has continually declined over the past several years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/moh/|title=Redirected|date=19 November 2019}}</ref>

Mohawk has the largest number of speakers among the [[Iroquois|Northern Iroquoian]] languages, and today it is the only one with more than a thousand remaining speakers.  At [[Akwesasne]], residents have begun a language immersion school (pre-K to grade 8) in ''Kanienʼkéha'' to revive the language. With their children learning it, parents and other family members are taking language classes, too.

A Mohawk language immersion school was established.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mohawkcommunity.com/languageimmersion.html|title=Kanatsiohareke Mohawk Community|website=www.mohawkcommunity.com|access-date=Sep 3, 2020}}</ref> Mohawk parents, concerned with the lack of culture-based education in public and parochial schools, founded the Akwesasne Freedom School in 1979. Six years later, the school implemented a Mohawk language immersion curriculum based on a traditional cycle of fifteen seasonal ceremonies, and on the Mohawk [[Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address|Thanksgiving Address]], or Ohén꞉ton Karihwatékwen, "The words before all else." Every morning, teachers and students gather in the hallway to recite the Thanksgiving Address in Mohawk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ourmothertongues.org/language/Mohawk/7|title=Our Mother Tongues &#124; Mohawk|first=Our Mother|last=Tongues|website=ourmothertongues.org|access-date=Sep 3, 2020}}</ref>

An adult immersion program was also created in 1985 to address the issue of intergenerational fluency decline of the Mohawk language.<ref>http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/view/8645.</ref>

'''Kanatsiohareke''' (Gah-nah-jo-ha-lay-gay), meaning "Place of the clean pot", is a small Mohawk community on the north bank of the [[Mohawk River]], west of [[Fonda, New York]].<sup>[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> Kanatsiohareke was created to be a "[[Carlisle Indian Boarding School]] in Reverse", teaching Mohawk language and culture.<sup>[[Kanatsiohareke|[2]]]</sup> Located at the ancient homeland of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), it was re-established in September 1993 under the leadership of Thomas R. Porter (Sakokwenionkwas-"The One Who Wins").<sup>[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup> The community must raise their own revenue and frequently hold cultural presentations, workshops, and academic events, including an annual Strawberry Festival.<sup>[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> A craft shop on site features genuine handmade Native crafts from all over North America.

The primary mission of the community is to try to preserve traditional values, culture, language and lifestyles in the guidance of the ''Kaienerekowa'' (Great Law of Peace).<sup>[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup> Kanatsiohareke, Inc. is a [[non-profit organization]] under IRS code 501c3.

In 2006, over 600 people were reported to speak the language in Canada, many of them elderly.<ref name="ReferenceA">Statistics Canada, 2006 Census of Population, Statistics Canada catalogue no. 97-558-XCB2006015</ref>

'''[[Kahnawake]]''' is located at a metropolitan location, near central [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada. As Kahnawake is located near Montreal, many individuals speak both English and French, and this has contributed to a decline in the use of Mohawk language over the past century. The Mohawk Survival School, the first immersion program was established in 1979. The school's mission was to revitalize Mohawk language. To examine how successful the program had been, questionnaire was given to the Kahnawake residents following the first year. The results indicated that teaching towards younger generation have been successful and showed an increase in the ability to speak the language in private settings, as well as an increase in the mixing of Mohawk in English conversations were found.<ref>http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/12.2/hoover.pdf.</ref>

===Current number of speakers===
In 2011, there were approximately 3,500 speakers of Mohawk, primarily in Quebec, Ontario and western New York.<ref>Moseley, Christopher and R. E. Asher, ed. ''Atlas of World Languages'' (New York: Routelege, 1994) p. 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mohawk|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/moh|website=Ethnologue|access-date=Jan 26, 2016}}</ref> Immersion (monolingual) classes for young children at [[Akwesasne]] and other reserves are helping to train new first-language speakers. The importance of immersion classes among parents grew after the passage of [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]], and in 1979 the Mohawk Survival School was established to facilitate language training at the high school level.<ref>{{cite report |author= Michael Hoover|title= The Revival of the Mohawk Language in Kahnawake |url= http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/12.2/hoover.pdf}}</ref>

===Usage in popular culture===
Mohawk dialogue features prominently in [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s 2012 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[open world]] [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', through the game's main character, the half-Mohawk, half-English [[Ratonhnhaké꞉ton]], also called Connor, and members of his native [[Mohawk people#Mohawk communities today|Kanièn꞉ke]] village around the times of the [[American revolution]]. Ratonhnhaké꞉ton was voiced and modelled by [[Crow tribe|Crow]] actor [[Noah Watts|Noah Bulaagawish Watts]]. [[Hiawatha]], the leader of the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] civilization in ''[[Sid Meier's Civilization V]]'', voiced by Kanentokon Hemlock, speaks modern Mohawk.

The stories of Mohawk language learners are also chronicled in 'Raising The Words', a short documentary film released in 2016 that explores personal experiences with Mohawk language revitalization in [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]], a Mohawk community roughly 200 kilometres east of [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.<ref>http://www.raisingthewords.com/about/</ref> The film was set to be shown at the 4th annual Ethnografilm festival in [[Paris, France]].

The Mohawk language is used in the films ''[[Mohawk (2017 film)|Mohawk]]'' and ''[[Black Robe (film)|Black Robe]]'' and the television series ''[[Barkskins (TV series)|Barkskins]]''.

==Dialects==
Mohawk has three major dialects: Western (Ohswé:ken and Kenhté:ke), Central (Ahkwesáhsne), and Eastern (Kahnawà꞉ke and Kanehsatà꞉ke); the differences between them are largely phonological. These are related to the major Mohawk territories since the eighteenth century. The pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} and several consonant clusters may differ in the dialects.

==Phonology==
The phoneme inventory of Mohawk is as follows (using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]). Phonological representation (underlying forms) are in /slashes/, and the standard Mohawk orthography is in '''bold'''.

===Consonants===
An interesting feature of Mohawk (and Iroquoian) phonology is that there are no [[labial consonant|labials]] (m, p, b, f, v), except in a few adoptions from French and English, where {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[p]}} appear (e.g., '''mátsis''' ''matches'' and '''aplám''' ''Abraham''); these sounds are late additions to Mohawk phonology and were introduced after widespread European contact.

====Consonant Clusters====

The Central (Ahkwesáhsne) dialect has the following consonant clusters. 
All clusters can occur word-medially; those on a tinted background can also occur word-initially.

|}

Note that '''th''' and '''sh''' are pronounced as consonant clusters, ''not'' single sounds like in English ''thing'' and  ''she''.

====Consonant and Consonant Cluster Voicing====

The consonants {{IPA|/k/, /t/}} and the clusters {{IPA|/ts kw/}} are pronounced voiced before any voiced sound (i.e. a vowel or {{IPA|/j/}}). They are voiceless at the end of a word or before a voiceless sound. {{IPA|/s/}} is voiced word initially and between vowels.

:''car'' – '''kà꞉sere''' {{IPA|[ˈɡàːzɛrɛ]}}
:''that'' – '''thí꞉ken''' {{IPA|[ˈthiːɡʌ̃]}}
:''hello, still'' – '''shé꞉kon''' {{IPA|[ˈshɛːɡũ]}}

===Vowels===

|{{IPA|e}}
|{{IPA|ʌ̃}}
|{{IPA|o}}
|-
![[Open vowel|Low]]
|&nbsp;
|{{IPA|a}}
|&nbsp;
|}

'''i''', '''e''', '''a''', and '''o''' are [[oral vowel]]s, while  '''en''' (/{{IPA|ʌ̃}}/) and '''on''' (/{{IPA|ũ}}/) (see [[help:IPA]]) are [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]]; oral versions of /{{IPA|ʌ̃}}/ and /{{IPA|ũ}}/ do not occur in the language.

===[[Suprasegmental]]s===

In the standard spelling, a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] is placed after a vowel to lengthen it.  There are 4 tones: mid, high, mid-low falling and mid-high rising, the latter two appear on long vowels (marked as V:).

==Grammar==
[[File:Mohawk no-swimming sign.jpg|thumb|A warning sign in Mohawk]]

Mohawk words tend to be longer on average than words in English, primarily because they consist of a large amount of [[morphemes]], or 'meaningful parts'.

Mohawk expresses a number of distinctions on its pronominal elements: person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), gender (masculine, feminine/indefinite, feminine/neuter) and [[Inclusive and exclusive we|inclusivity/exclusivity]] on the first person dual and plural. Pronominal information is encoded in prefixes on the verbs; separate pronoun words are used for emphasis. There are three main paradigms of pronominal prefixes: subjective (with dynamic verbs), objective (with stative verbs), and transitive.

There are three core components to the Mohawk proposition: the noun, the predicate, and the particle.<ref name=":0"/>

Mohawk words can be composed of many morphemes. What is expressed in English in many words can often be expressed by just one Mohawk word, a phenomenon known as [[polysynthetic language|polysynthesis]].

===Nouns===
Nouns are given the following form in Mohawk:<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = A Grammar Of Awkwesasne Mohawk|last = Bonvillain|first = Nancy|publisher = National Museum of Man, National Museums of Canada|year = 1973}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = A Thousand Words Of Mohawk|last = Michelson|first = Günther|publisher = National Museum of Man, National Museums Of Canada|year = 1973}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = One thousand useful Mohawk words|last = Maracle|first = David|publisher = Audio-Forum|location = Guilford, Conn}}</ref>

{| class="wikitable"
!Nominal Prefix
!Noun Stem
!Nominal Suffix
|}

Noun prefixes give information relating to gender, animacy, number and person, and identify the word as a noun.

For example:

1) '''oʼ'''nenste   "corn"

2) '''o'''ienʼkwa  "tobacco"

Here, the prefix  ''o-'' is generally found on nouns found in natural environments. Another prefix exists which marks objects that are made by humans.

3) '''ka'''nhoha     "door"

4) '''kaʼ'''khare  "slip, skirt"

Here, the prefix ''ka-'' is generally found on human-made things. Phonological variation amongst the Mohawk dialects also gives rise to the prefix ''ga-''.

Noun roots are similar to nouns in English in that the noun root in Mohawk and the noun in English have similar meanings.

(Caughnawaha)

5) –eri-  "heart"

6) –hi- "river"

7) –itshat- "cloud"

These noun roots are bare. There is no information other than the noun root itself. Morphemes cannot occur individually. That is, to be well-formed and grammatical, ''-eri-'' needs pronominal prefixes, or the root can be incorporated into a predicate phrase.

Nominal suffixes aren't necessary for a well-formed noun phrase. The suffixes give information relating to location and attributes. For example:

Locative Suffix:

8) i. onuʼtaʼ              "hill"

ii. onutaʼ'''ke'''  "'''on''' the hill"

9) i. onekwvhsaʼ       "blood"

ii. onekwvhsaʼ'''ke'''   "'''in''' the blood"

Here the suffix < -ke > denotes location.

Attributive Suffix:

10) kvjyʼ                  "fish"

11) kvjaʼ'''koʼwa'''       "sturgeon" or "big fish"

Here, the suffix ''-koʼwa'' denotes an augmentative suffix, which increases the attribute of the noun in question.

===Verbs===
Mohawk verbs are one of the more complex parts of the language, composed of many morphemes that describe grammatical relations. The verb takes the following structure:<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
{| class="wikitable"
!Pre-Pronominal Prefix
!Pronominal Prefix
!Reflexive And Reciprocal Particle
!Incorporated Noun Root
!Verb Root
!Suffixes
|}
Mohawk grammar allows for whole propositions to be expressed by one word, which we classify as a verb. The other core elements (subjects, objects, etc.) can be [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporated]] into the verb. Well-formed verb phrases contain at the bare minimum a verb root and a pronominal prefix. The rest of the elements are not necessary.

Tense, aspect and [[linguistic modality|modality]] are expressed via suffixes on the verb phrase as well.

Some examples:

{{interlinear|number=(12)
|top= katorats
|k- atorat- s
|1SG- hunt HAB
|"I hunt"}}

This is composed of three parts; the pronominal prefix, the verb root and a suffix which marks aspect. Mohawk seems to prefer aspect markers to tense to express grammaticalisation in time.

{{interlinear|number=(13)|abbreviations=TRLOC:translocative
|top= nyaʼtsvshayayaʼkeʼ
|n-  yaʼ-  t-  v-   s-    ha-   yahyaʼk- eʼ
|PTV TRLOC DU- FUT- ITER- noun- verb-    {root suffix}
|"…where he will cross over again from here to there…"}}

This example shows multiple prefixes that can be affixed to the verb root, but certain affixes are forbidden from coexisting together. For example, the aorist and the future tense affix will not be found on the same well-formed sentence.

{{interlinear|number=(14)|abbreviations=ROOT:root
|top= vsenataraʼ
|v- se- natahr- aʼ
|FUT NOM-PRO VB-ROOT {momentary ASP suffix}
|"You will make a visit"}}

{{interlinear|number=(15)|abbreviations=ROOT:root
|top= asenataraʼ
|a-   se-     natahr-  aʼ
|COND NOM-PRO VB-ROOT {momentary suffix}
|"You should make a visit"}}

{{interlinear|number=(16)|abbreviations=ROOT:root
|top= sanatahruneʼ
|sa-     natahr- u-   hneʼ
|ACC-PRO VB-ROOT STAT {momentary suffix}
|"You were visiting"}}

Here, different prefixes and suffixes are used that mark tense, aspect and modality.

Most grammatical relations in Mohawk are expressed through various different affixes onto a verb. Subjects, objects, and relationships between subjects and objects are given their own affixes. In Mohawk, each transitive relationship between subjects and objects are given their own prefix. For example:

{{interlinear|number=(17a)
|ku- noruhkwa
|I-you love
|"I love you"}}

{{interlinear|number=(17b)
|ri- noruhkwa
|I-him love
|"I love him"}}

{{interlinear|number=(17c)
|ke- noruhkwa
|I-it/her love
|"I love it/her"}}

Each of these affixes are denoting a transitive relationship between two things. There are more affixes for denoting transitive relationships like "we-they", they-us (inclusive/exclusive), etc.

===Noun incorporation===

One of the features of Mohawk called ''noun incorporation'' allows a verb to absorb a noun into it. When incorporation happens, an epenthetic ''a'' can appear between the noun root and the verb root.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> For example:

18) Owiraʼa wahrakeʼ ne oʼwahru

Baby      ate        the  meat

With noun incorporation:

19) Owiraʼa wah'''a'''ʼwahrakeʼ

Baby     meat-ate

20) Waʼeksohareʼ                 "She dish-washed"   ks = dish, ohare=wash

21) Waʼkenakt'''a'''hninuʼ           "I bed-bought"   nakt = bed + a (increment) + hninu=buy

22) Wahanaʼtar'''a'''kwetareʼ     "He bread-cut"           naʼtar = bread + a (increment) + kwetar=cut

Most of these examples take the epenthetic vowel ''a''; it can be omitted if the incorporated noun doesn't give rise a complex consonant cluster in the middle of the word.

==Orthography==
[[File:Trilingual plaque on the Grand River, Cambridge, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Plaque in English, Mohawk, and French describing the Grand River. Plaque located in Galt, Cambridge, Ontario]]
The Mohawk alphabet consists of these letters: '''a e h i k n o r s t w y''' along with '''[[ʼ]]''' and '''꞉''' (see [[modifier letter apostrophe]] and [[modifier letter colon]]). The orthography was standardized in 1993.<ref name="Standarization">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kanienkehaka.com/msp/msp.htm |title="Mohawk Language Standardization Project", Kanienkehaka |access-date=2006-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234850/http://www.kanienkehaka.com/msp/msp.htm |archive-date=2013-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The standard allows for some variation of how the language is represented, and the clusters {{IPA|/ts(i)/}}, {{IPA|/tj/}}, and {{IPA|/ky/}} are written as pronounced in each community. The orthography matches the phonological analysis as above except:
*The glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is written with an apostrophe '''ʼ''', it is often omitted at the end of words, especially in Eastern dialect where it is typically not pronounced.
*{{IPA|/dʒ/}}
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''ts''' in the Eastern dialect (reflecting pronunciation). ''Seven'' is '''tsá꞉ta''' {{IPA|[dzaːda]}}.
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''tsi''' in the Central dialect. ''Seven'' is '''tsiá꞉ta''' {{IPA|[dʒaːda]}}.
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''tsy''' in the Western dialect. ''Seven'' is '''tsyá꞉ta''' {{IPA|[dʒaːda]}}.
*{{IPA|/j/}}
**{{IPA|/j/}} is typically written '''i''' in the Central and Eastern dialects. ''Six'' is '''ià꞉iaʼk''' {{IPA|[jàːjaʔk]}}.
**{{IPA|/j/}} is usually written '''y''' in the Western dialect. ''Six'' is '''yà꞉yaʼk''' {{IPA|[jàːjaʔk]}}.
*The vowel {{IPA|/ʌ̃/}} is written '''en''', as in ''one'' '''énska''' {{IPA|[ʌ̃ska]}}.
*The vowel {{IPA|/ũ/}} is written '''on''', as in ''eight'' '''shaʼté꞉kon''' {{IPA|[shaʔdɛːɡũ]}}.
*In cases where the vowel /e/ or /o/ is followed by an /n/ in the same syllable, the /n/ is written with an under-macron diacritic: '''keṉhó꞉tons''' (I am closing a door). If the '''ṉ''' did not have the diacritic, the sequence {{angle bracket|en}} would be pronounced {{IPA|[ʌ̃]}}. Another convention is to write the nasal vowel with an [[ogonek]], e.g. {{angle bracket|ę}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohwejagehka.com/mohawk/|title=Mohawk Language - Ohwejagehka Hadegaenage|website=www.ohwejagehka.com|access-date=Sep 3, 2020}}</ref>
The low-macron accent is not a part of standard orthography and isn't used by the Central or Eastern dialects.
In standard orthography, /h/ is written before /n/ to create the [en] or [on]: '''kehnhó꞉tons''' 'I am closing it'.

===Stress, length, and tone===
Stress, vowel length and tone are linked together in Mohawk. There are three kinds of stressed vowels: short-high tone, long-high tone, and long-falling tone. Stress is always written and occurs only once per word.
*Short-high tone usually (but not always) appears in closed syllables or before /h/. It is written with an acute accent: ''fruit'' '''káhi''', ''road'' '''oháha'''.
*Long-rising tone generally occurs in open syllables. It is written with a combination acute accent and colon: ''town'' '''kaná꞉ta''', ''man'' '''rón꞉kwe'''. Notice that when it is one of the nasal vowels which is long, the colon appears after the '''n'''.
*Long-falling tone is the result of the word stress falling on a vowel which comes before a {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} + a consonant (there may be, of course, exceptions to this and other rules). The underlying {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} reappears when stress is placed elsewhere. It is written with a grave accent and colon: ''stomach'' '''onekwèn꞉ta''' (from {{IPA|/onekwʌ̃ʔta/}}).

The Central (Ahkwesáhsne) dialect has the following consonant clusters:{{Which|date=November 2020}}
