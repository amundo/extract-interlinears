'''Kambera''', also known as '''East Sumbanese''', is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] spoken in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Indonesia]]. Kambera is a member of Bima-Sumba subgrouping within Central Malayo-Polynesian inside Malayo-Polynesian.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998}}</ref> The island of Sumba, located in Eastern Indonesia, has an area of 12,297&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998}}</ref> The name Kambera comes from a traditional region which is close to a town in Waingapu. Because of export trades which concentrated in [[Waingapu]] in the 19th century, the language of the Kambera region has become the bridging language in eastern Sumba.

==Morpho-syntax==

===[[Affirmation and negation|Negation]]===
Negators are used in Kambera, and other languages, to make a clause or sentence negative in meaning. Kambera has several types of negators. There are six main types of negators listed below. 
{| class="wikitable"
!Negators
!English translation
|-
|nda
|negation
|-
|ndia
|emphatic negation
|-
|ndedi
|'not yet'
|-
|àmbu
|'won't, don't' (irrealis negation)
|-
|àmbu...ndoku
|'won't/don't...at all'
|-
|nda...ndoku
|'not...at all'
|}

''Ndia'' 'no' is used for general negation, and ''nda'' 'negative' or ''ndedi'' 'not yet' are predicate negators. ''Ndoku'' is used to emphasise the negation by being placed with the negator ''àmbu'' or ''nda''.<ref name="Klamer 2005 p723">{{harvnb|Klamer|2005|p=723}}</ref>

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Ambu bobar ndoku -ma -ya!
|NEG.IRR preach NEG.EMP -EMP -3SG.ACC.EMP
|"Do not talk about it at all!"<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=143}}</ref>}}

''Àmbu'' is used to express future negation, as well as negation in [[Imperative mood|imperatives]].<ref name="Klamer 2005 p723" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Àmbu katuda{{=}}kau nàhu!
|NEG.IRR sleep{{=}}2SG.ACC now
|"Don't go to sleep now!"<ref name="Klamer 2005 p723" />}}

Negators are elements in a clause that are deictic. They can be used to refer to time, space and discourse.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=142}}</ref> Shown below, the negator, ''ndia'' is used to refer to discourse.

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Ndia ná!
|NEG DEI
|"No!" (not like that)<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=142}}</ref>}}

Two of these negators nda and àmbu – with ''nda'' being a general negator, are used for nominal and verbal predicates. 

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Nda ningu ndoku
|NEG be NEG.EMP
|"There are none at all."<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=143}}</ref>}}

==== Negators into verbs ====
The word ''pa'' in Kambera is derivational and can be added to few prepositional nouns, numerals and negators to create verbs. The emphatic negator ''ndia'' 'no' can become a verb through ''pa'' [[Morphological derivation|derivation]]. The translation of this verb then becomes "to deny".<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=184}}</ref>

Example below of how ''ndia'' is constructed into a verb in a given phrase:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|na- pa.ndia -ya ba nda na- njala
|3SG.NOM- pa.no -3SG.ACC.EMP CNJ NEG 3SG.NOM {be/do wrong}
|"He denied that he did wrong."<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=185}}</ref>}}

==== Noun phrases ====
A nuclear clause has the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] as the head in Kambera, and [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] are positioned at the beginning of the clause. As ''nda'' is a modifier it is placed at the beginning of a clause, as a clause-initial negator, before the verb and the rest of the elements of a nuclear clause.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=77}}</ref>

You can distinguish nominal clauses from NPs is through the irrealis negator ''àmbu'' and the negator ''nda'', which both never occur inside a possessed NP.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=99}}</ref>

====[[Clitic|Clitics]]====
The Kambera word ''nda'' is also considered to be a pro-clitic as well, as they do not conform to the minimal word requirement and must occur with a syntactic/phonological host.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=27}}</ref> A clitic is a type of bound [[morpheme]] which is syntactically free, but are phonologically bound morphemes. They can attach themselves to a stem, for example the negator ''nda''. ''Nda'' appears before its host and is used to mark negation. It has a very simple phonotactic properties and cannot carry stress. <ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=47}}</ref>''Nda'' as a clitic can only ever occur with a host. 

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Ka 'nggiki hi nda {{=}}u- 'ita -ka?
|CNJ why CNJ NEG 2PL.PN- see -1SG.ACC.EMP
|"Why didn't you see me?"<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=50}}</ref>}}

In the example above, the negator ''nda'' becomes ''nda u-'' [ndaw], with ''nda'' attaching itself to the [[allomorph]] ''u-'' .<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=50}}</ref> ''Nda''  is a proclitic that marks an embedded clause in Kambera.

=== Relative clauses ===
Negators are also included in [[Relative clause|relative clauses]], but are not a part of the noun phrase. 

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|[Nda [ndui pa- bohu]<sub>NP</sub>] -ya
|NEG money RmO- steal -3SG.ACC.EMP
|"It (is) not stolen money."<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=336}}</ref>}}

=== Pronouns and person markers ===
Personal pronouns are used in Kambera for emphasis/disambiguation and the syntactic relation between full pronouns and [[clitic]]s is similar to that between NPs and clitics. NPs and pronouns have morphological [[Grammatical case|case]].

Kambera, as a [[head-marking language]], has rich morpho-syntactic marking on its predicators. The pronominal, aspectual and/or mood clitics together with the predicate constitute the nuclear [[clause]]. Definite verbal arguments are crossreferenced on the predicate for person, number and case ([[Nominative case|Nominative]] (N), [[Genitive case|Gentive]] (G), [[Dative case|Dative]] (D), [[Accusative case|Accusative]] (A)). The four main pronominal clitic paradigms are given below.

|go-1SG.CONT mother say-3SG
|"'I am going, mother,' he said."}}

=== Possession ===
Kambera has a possessive or reflexive noun ''wiki'' 'self/own', which can be
used to mark possession (1). 

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|Uma wiki -nggu
|house self/own -1SG.GEN
|'My own house'}}

''Wiki'' has the structural properties of a noun and can be used as a nominal modifier (compare 2 & 3), unlike pronouns which must be cross-referenced on the noun with a genitive clitic (3).<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=130–131}}</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|Uma witu -nggu
|house grass -1SG.GEN
|'My hut'}}

{{interlinear|number=(3)
|Uma -nggu nyungga
|house -1SG.GEN I
|'My house'}}

As (3) is a possessed noun phrase, the enclitic attaches to the noun. In possessed and modified noun phrases, the genitive enclitic attaches to the noun modifier (4).<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=48}}</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(4)
|Na uma 'bakul -nggu
|ART house {be big} -1SG.GEN
|'My big house'}}

In Kambera, where cross-referencing is used, the noun phrase is optional. A verb along with its pronominal markers constitutes a complete sentence. Pronominal clitics are a morphological way of expressing relationships between syntactic constituents such as a noun and its possessor.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=60–61}}</ref>

==== Possessor relativisation ====
Possessors can be relativised with a ''ma-'' relative clause.<ref>{{harvnb|Klamer|1998|p=320–321}}</ref> There are three types of clauses used in the relativisation of possessors.

The first is when the embedded verb is derived from a relational noun such as mother or child. These derived transitive verbs express relations between the subject and the object (5).

{{interlinear|number=(5)
|Na anakeda [na ma- ina -nya]
|ART child [ART RmS- mother -3SG.DAT]
|'the child whose mother she is'/'the child she is the mother of'}}

The second clause type is where the possessor is the head of the ma- relative clause and the possessee is the subject of the embedded verb (6).

{{interlinear|number=(6)
|Ita -nggu -nya [na tau na ma-meti {kuru uma} -na]
|See -1SG.GEN -3SG.DAT [ART person ART RmS-die wife -3SG.GEN]
|'I saw [the man whose wife died]}}

The final type is where the relative clause contains the verb ''ningu'' 'be' and the incorporated argument of this verb. The head of the relative construction is the possessor (7).

{{interlinear|number=(7)
|Na tau na ma- ningu ihi woka .ng
|ART person ART RmS- be content garden .ng|c2=N.B: the morpheme ''.ng'' marks the edge of incorporation
|'the person that has crops' ({{lit}} 'the person whose garden content is')}}

Normally, the possessor pronoun ''nyuna'' 'he/she' follows the possessed noun (8), though it can also be the head of a relativised clause (9).

{{interlinear|number=(8)
|Na marihak [na kalembi -na nyuna]
|ART {be dirty} [ART shirt -3SG.GEN he]
|'His shirt is dirty'}}

{{interlinear|number=(9)
|Nyuna na [ma- marihak na kalembi -na
|He ART RmS- {be dirty} ART shirt -3SG.GEN
|'He whose shirt is dirty'}}

Possessors can also be relativised in the same way as subjects. For example, in the following headless relative clause (no possessor NP is present), a definite article is present (10).

{{interlinear|number=(10)
|Na ma- rabih karaha kalai -na
|ART RmS- trickle side left -3SG.GEN
|'The (one) whose left side trickles (i.e. lets water through)'
(mythological character that is the source of rain)}}
