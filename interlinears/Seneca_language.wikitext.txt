'''Seneca''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|ə}};<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> in Seneca, {{lang|see|Onödowáʼga꞉}} or {{lang|see|Onötowáʼka꞉}}) is the language of the [[Seneca people]], one of the Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]] League; it is an Iroquoian language, spoken at the time of contact in the western portion of New York.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=1}}</ref> While the name ''Seneca'', attested as early as the seventeenth century, is of obscure origins, the endonym {{lang|see|Onödowáʼga꞉}} translates to "those of the big hill."<ref name=":0" /> About 10,000 Seneca live in the United States and Canada, primarily on reservations in western [[New York (state)|New York]], with others living in [[Oklahoma]] and near [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], [[Ontario]]. As of 2013, an active language revitalization program is underway.

== Classification and history ==
Seneca is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Seneca people, one of the members of the Iroquois Five (later, Six) Nations confederacy.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=The Seneca Language (A Study in Iroquoian)|last=Holmer|first=Nils M.|publisher=Upsala Canadian Studies|year=1954|location=Upsala|pages=11}}</ref> It is most closely related to the other Five Nations Iroquoian languages, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk (and among those, it is most closely related to Cayuga).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Berkeley|pages=1}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Seneca is first attested in two damaged dictionaries produced by the French Jesuit missionary Julien Garnier around the turn of the eighteenth century. It is clear from these documents, and from early nineteenth century Seneca writings, that the eighteenth century saw an extremely high degree of phonological change, such that the Seneca collected by Garnier would likely be mutually unintelligible with modern Seneca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Berkeley|pages=2}}</ref> Moreover, as these sound changes appear to be unique to Seneca, they have had the effect of making Seneca highly phonologically divergent from the languages most closely related to it, as well as making the underlying morphological richness of the language incredibly opaque.<ref name="Chafe, 1967, p. 6" /> Today, Seneca is spoken primarily in western New York, on three reservations, Allegany, Cattaraugus, and Tonawanda, and in Ontario, on the Grand River Six Nations Reserve.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" /> While the speech community has dwindled to approximately one hundred native speakers, revitalization efforts are underway.

== Phonology ==
Seneca words are written with 13 letters, three of which can be [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlauted]], plus the [[colon (letter)|letter colon]] (꞉) and the acute accent mark. Seneca language is generally written in all-[[lowercase]], and capital letters are only used rarely, even then only for the first letter of a word; all-caps is never used, even on road signs. The vowels and consonants are ''a, ä, e, ë, i, o, ö, h, j, k, n, s, t, w, y'', and [[glottal stop (letter)|''ʼ'']].<ref>Chafe, 1963, p.4</ref><ref>Preston, 1949, p.23</ref> In some transliterations, ''t'' is replaced by ''d'', and likewise ''k'' by ''g''; Seneca does not have a phonemic differentiation between voiced and voiceless consonants (see below in Phonology 2.1: Consonants). The letter ''j'' can also be replaced by the [[trigraph (orthography)|three-letter combination]] ''tsy''. (For example, a creek in the town of [[Coldspring, New York]], and the community near it, bears a name that can be transliterated as either ''jonegano꞉h'' or ''tsyo꞉nekano꞉h''.)

===Consonants===
As per Wallace Chafe's 2015 grammar of Seneca, the consonantal and non-vocalic inventory of Seneca is as follows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=10}}</ref> Note that orthographic representations of these sounds are given in angled brackets where different from the IPA transcription.

/w/ is a velar semivowel. It is weakly [[Roundedness|rounded]] [w].

/n/ is a released apico-alveolar nasal [n̺].<ref name="Chafe, 1967, p. 5">Chafe, 1967, p. 5, 8, 15-18</ref>

====Oral obstruents====
/t/ is an apico-alveolar stop [t̺].  It is voiceless and [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [t̺ʰ] before an obstruent or an open juncture (but is hardly audible between a nasalized vowel and open juncture). It is voiced and released [d̺] before a vowel and resonant.

/k/ is a dorso-velar stop [k]. It is voiceless and aspirated [kʰ] before an obstruent or open juncture. It is voiced and released [g] before a vowel or resonant.

/s/ is a spirant with blade-alveolar groove articulation [s]. It is always voiceless, and is fortified to [s˰]{{clarify|date=November 2013}} everywhere except between vowels. It is palatalized to [ʃ] before [j],{{clarify|date=November 2013}} and lenited to [s˯]{{clarify|date=November 2013}} intervocalically.<ref name="Chafe, 1967, p. 5"/>

/dʒ/ is a voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ], and /dz/ a voiced alveolar affricate [dz].

===Vowels===
The vowels can be subclassified into the oral vowels /i/, /e/, /æ/, /a/, and /o/, and the nasalized vowels /ɛ/ and /ɔ/. Of these vowels, /æ/ is relatively rare, an innovation not shared with other Five Nations Iroquoian languages; even rarer is /u/, a vowel only used to describe unusually small objects.<ref name="Chafe, 1967, p. 5"/><ref name="Campbell">{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = George L. | title = Compendium of the World's Languages | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-20297-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/compendiumofworl00camp/page/1474 1474] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/compendiumofworl00camp/page/1474 }}</ref> Note that orthographic representations of these sounds are given in angled brackets where different from the IPA transcription.

/o/ is a mid back vowel. It is weakly rounded. Its high allophone [ʊ] occurs in postconsonantal position before [i] or an oral obstruent. Its low allophone [o] occurs in all other environments.<ref name="Chafe, 1967, p. 5"/>

/u/ is a rounded high back vowel [u]. It has also, however, been recorded as [ɯ].<ref name=":1" />

===Diphthongs===
The following oral [[diphthong]]s occur in Seneca:  ae, ai, ao, ea, ei, eo, oa, oe, and oi.
 
The following nasal diphthongs occur as well: aö, eö, and oë.{{clarify|date=November 2013}}<ref>Holmer, 1952, p. 217</ref>

===Prosody===
[[Vowel length]] is marked with a colon {{angle bracket|꞉}}, and open juncture by word space.<ref name="Chafe, 1960, p. 12">Chafe, 1960, p. 12</ref> Long vowels generally occur in one of two environments: 1. In even-numbered (i.e. falling and even number of syllables from the beginning of the word) word-penultimate syllables not followed by a laryngeal stop; and 2. In odd-numbered penultimate syllables that A. are followed by only one non-vocalic segment before the succeeding vowel, B. are not followed by a laryngeal stop, and C. do not contain the vowel [a] (unless the syllable is word-initial). Moreover, vowels are often lengthened compensitorally as the reflex of a short vowel and an (elided) glottal segment (e.g. vowels are long preceding glottal fricatives elided before sonorants (*V̆hR > V̄R)).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=12–13}}</ref>

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is either strong, marked with an acute accent mark (e.g. ⟨é⟩), or weak, which is unmarked (e.g. ⟨e⟩).<ref name="Chafe, 1960, p. 12" /> Seneca accented short vowels are typically higher in pitch than their unaccented counterparts, while accented long vowels have been recorded as having a falling pitch. Short vowels are typically accented in a trochaic pattern, when they appear in even-numbered syllables preceding A. a laryngeal obstruent, B. a cluster of non-vocalic segments, or C. an odd-numbered syllable containing either A or B. There does not appear to be any upper or lower limit on how many such syllables can be accented – every even-numbered syllable in a word can be accented, but none need be accented. Syllables can also be stressed by means of accent spreading, if an unaccented vowel is followed immediately by a stressed vowel (i.e. VV́ > V́V́). Additionally, word-initial and word-final syllables are underlyingly unaccented, although they can be given sentence level stress.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=14–15}}</ref>

=== Syllable structure ===
Seneca allows both open and closed syllables; a Seneca syllable is considered to be closed when the nucleus is followed by a cluster of multiple consonants. Moreover, [h] appears to be ambisyllabic intervocalically, and can be included in a cluster of multiple non-consonantal segments in the onset.<ref name=":2" />

== Morphology ==
Seneca is a polysynthetic, agglutinative language with a remarkably rich verbal morphological system, and to a lesser extent, a fairly rich system of nominal morphology as well. Verbs constitute a decisive majority of Seneca words (by one estimate, as much as eighty-five percent of different words),<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=23}}</ref> and between the numerous classes of morphemes that can added to the verb root, the generally multiple morphemes constituent thereto, and the variants thereof, a truly staggering number of Seneca verbs is grammatically possible. While most verb forms have multiple allomorphs, however, in the majority of cases, variants of morphemes cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of its phonological environment.

=== Verbal morphology ===

==== Composition of the verb base<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oaklands|pages=61–75}}</ref> ====
The verb base can be augmented by adding a derivational suffix, a middle voice or reflexive prefix, or an incorporated noun root. The common middle voice prefix describes actions performed by on agent and received by that same agent. Its forms, in descending order or prevalence, are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Forms of the middle voice prefix
!Morpheme
!Environment
|-
|<nowiki>-at-</nowiki>
|Primarily, before roots beginning in vowels or resonants followed by a vowel.
|-
| -ate-
|Before most clusters of multiple consonants.
|-

|Before n, or laryngeal obstruents followed by n.
|-
|<nowiki>-atë-</nowiki>
|In the above environment, but with a historically distinct group of bases
|-
|<nowiki>-ën-</nowiki>
|Before some bases beginning with i.
|-
|<nowiki>-an-</nowiki>
|In the above environment, but with a historically distinct group of bases.
|-

|Before some bases beginning with ah.
|-
| -ëni-, -a-
|Each appears with one verb root each, -sʼoht-, "hand," and -tsëh-, "fire," respectively.
|}
The similar reflexive prefix is nearly semantically identical, the only difference being that the reflexive prefix more clearly distinguishes the two (unitary) roles of agent and recipient. Its forms are not regularly predictable by phonetic environment, and are derived from the underlying form -at-. A noun can be incorporated into the verb base by placing it before the middle voice or reflexive prefix (i.e. at the front of the base noun), such that that noun becomes the patient (or often, instrument or manner) of the verb. In between noun-final and prefix/verb root-initial consonants, the "stem-joining" vowel -a- is epenthesized. The following types of derivational suffixes can be added at the end of a base noun to alter the meaning of the verb; these are as follows (given with the underlying form or most common form of the suffix):

==== Aspect suffixes ====
Seneca verbs consist of a verb base that represents a certain event or state, which always includes a verb root; this is always followed by an aspect suffix, and almost always preceded by a pronominal prefix. Pronominal prefixes can describe an agent, a patient, or the object of the verb, while aspect suffixes can be habitual or stative, describing four types of meanings: habitual, progressive, stative, and perfect. Bases are classified as "consequential" or "nonconsequential," on the basis of whether or not they "result in a new state of affairs." Nonconsequential bases use habitual aspect suffixes to describe habitual actions, and stative aspect stems to describe progressive actions. Consequential bases use habitual aspect suffixes to describe habitual or progressive actions, and stative aspect stems to describe perfect actions. Some verb roots are said to be stative-only; these typically describe long states (e.g. "to be heavy," "to be old," etc.). Habitual and stative roots are related to the ending of the verb base, but have become largely arbitrary, or at least inconsistent. Additionally, there is a common punctual suffix, an aspect suffix that is added to describe punctual events. It necessarily takes the "modal prefix," which precedes a pronominal prefix, and indicate the relationship of the action described in the verb to reality; these three prefixes are factual, future, and hypothetical. A list of forms of each of the stems is as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=23–29}}</ref>

==== Pronominal morphology ====
The system of pronominal prefixes attached to Seneca verbs is incredibly rich, as each pronoun accounts not only for the agent of an action, but for the recipient of that action (i.e. "patient") as well. For example, the first person singular prefix is k- ~ ke- when there is no patient involved, but kö- ~ köy- when the patient is 2sg, kni- ~ kn- ~ ky- when the patient is 2du., and kwa- ~ kwë- ~ kw- ~ ky- when the patient is 2pl. There are fifty-five possible pronominal pronouns, depending on who is performing an action, and who is receiving that action. These pronouns express number as singular, dual, or plural; moreover, in the case of pronominal prefixes describing agents, there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person. Gender and animacy are expressed as well in the third person; gender distinctions are made between masculine entities and "feminine-zoic" entities (i.e. women and animals), and inanimacy is distinguished in singular forms. Moreover, before pronominal prefixes, "preproniminal" prefixes carrying a variety of meanings can be placed to modify the meaning of the verb. The prefixes, in the order in which the precede one another, are as follows:<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=31–36}}</ref>

=== Nominal morphology<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-520-28641-2|location=Oakland|pages=86–91}}</ref> ===
Seneca nominal morphology is far simpler than verbal morphology. Nouns consist of a noun root followed by a noun suffix and a pronominal prefix. The noun suffix appears as either a simple noun suffix (denoting, naturally, that it is a noun), an external locative suffix, denoting that something is "on" or "at" that noun, or an internal locative suffix, denoting that something is "in" that noun. The forms of these are as follows:

- Simple noun suffix: -aʼ ~ -öʼ (in a nasalizing context)

- External locative suffix: -aʼgeh

- Internal locative suffix: -aʼgöh

Nouns are often preceded by pronominal prefixes, but in this context, they represent possession, as opposed to agency or reception. Nouns without pronominal prefixes are preceded by either the neuter patient prefix yo- ~ yaw- ~ ya-, or the neuter agent prefix ka- ~ kë- ~ w- ~ y-. These morphemes do not hold semantic value, and are historically linked to certain noun roots arbitrarily. Finally, certain prepronominal verbal prefixes can be suffixed to nouns to alter the meaning thereof; in particular, the cislocative, coincident, negative, partitive, and repetitive fall into this group.

== Syntax ==
As much of what, in other languages, might be included in a clause is included in the Seneca word, Seneca features free word order, and cannot be neatly categorized along the lines of a subject/object/verb framework. Rather, new information appears first in the Seneca sentence; when a noun is judged by the speaker to be more "newsworthy" than a verb in the same sentence, it is likely to appear before the verb; should it not be deemed to hold such relevance, it typically follows the verb.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Chafe|first=Wallace|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-1-897367-13-1|location=Oakland|pages=147}}</ref> Particles, the only Seneca words that cannot be classified as nouns or verbs,<ref name=":3" /> appear to follow the same ordering paradigm. Moreover, given the agent/participant distinction that determines the forms of pronominal morphemes, it seems appropriate to consider Seneca a nominative-accusative language.<ref name=":4" />

=== Coordination ===
In Seneca, multiple constituents of a sentence can be conjoined, in a number of ways. They are summarized as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Seneca Language|last=Carzis|first=Peter|publisher=University of California Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-1-897367-13-1|location=Oakland|pages=149–51}}</ref>

As of summer 2012,
<blockquote> 
The fewer than 50 native speakers of the [[Seneca Nation of Indians]]' language would agree that it is in danger of becoming extinct. Fortunately, a $200,000 federal grant for the Seneca Language Revitalization Program has further solidified a partnership with [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] that will help develop a user-friendly computer catalogue allowing future generations to study and speak the language.

The revitalization program grant, awarded to RIT's Native American Future Stewards Program, is designed to enhance usability of the Seneca language.<ref>{{Cite news

Although Seneca-owned radio station [[WGWE]] (whose call sign derives from "gwe," a Seneca word roughly translating to "what's up?") broadcasts primarily in English, it features a daily "Seneca Word of the Day" feature before each noon newscast, broadcasts a limited amount of Seneca-language music, and makes occasional use of the Seneca language in its broadcasts in a general effort to increase awareness of the Seneca language by the general public.

In 2013, the first public sports event was held in the Seneca language, when middle school students served as announcers for a [[lacrosse]] match.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.observertoday.com/page/content.detail/id/584545/Students-announce-lacrosse-games-in-Seneca-language.html?nav=5010|title=Students announce lacrosse games in Seneca language|date=2013-05-10|work=The Observer, ObserverToday.com|access-date=2013-05-13|location=Dunkirk, NY}}</ref>

Bilingual road signs, such as [[stop sign]]s and speed limit signs, appear in the Seneca capital of [[Jimerson Town, New York|Jimersontown]]; these signs were erected in 2016. Prior to this, as part of the upgrade to [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania–New York)|Interstate 86]], the names of townships within the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] were marked in Seneca along the highway in [[Comic Sans MS|Comic Sans]].
