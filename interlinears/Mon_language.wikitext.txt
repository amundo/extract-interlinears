Mon, like the related [[Khmer language]], but unlike most languages in [[mainland Southeast Asia]], is not tonal.

==History==
Mon is an important language in Burmese history. Until the 12th century, it was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy valley]]—not only in the Mon kingdoms of the lower Irrawaddy but also of the upriver [[Pagan Kingdom]] of the [[Bamar people]]. Mon, especially written Mon, continued to be a [[prestige language]] even after the fall of the Mon [[Thaton Kingdom|kingdom of Thaton]] to Pagan in 1057. King [[Kyansittha]] of Pagan (r. 1084–1113) admired Mon culture and the Mon language was patronized. 
[[File:Myazedi-Inscription-Mon.JPG|left|thumb|236x236px|The Mon [[Myazedi Inscription]] (AD 1113) is Myanmar's oldest surviving stone inscription.]]
Kyansittha left many inscriptions in Mon. During this period, the [[Myazedi inscription]], which contains identical inscriptions of a story in [[Pali]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], Mon and Burmese on the four sides, was carved.<ref name="tarling"/> However, after Kyansittha's death, usage of the Mon language declined among the Bamar and the [[Burmese language]] began to replace Mon and Pyu as a [[lingua franca]].<ref name="tarling">{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Strachan | year=1990 | title=Imperial Pagan: Art and Architecture of Burma | publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] | pages=66 | isbn=0-8248-1325-1}}</ref>

Mon inscriptions from [[Dvaravati]]'s ruins also litter [[Thailand]]. However it is not clear if the inhabitants were Mon, a mix of Mon and Malay or Khmer. Later inscriptions and kingdoms like [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]] were subservient to the [[Khmer Empire]].

After the fall of Pagan, Mon again became the lingua franca of the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1287–1539) in present-day [[Lower Myanmar]], which remained a predominantly Mon-speaking region until the 1800s, by which point, the [[Burmese language]] had expanded its reach from its traditional heartland in [[Upper Myanmar|Upper Burma]] into [[Lower Myanmar|Lower Burma]].

The region's language shift from Mon to Burmese has been ascribed to a combination of population displacement, intermarriage, and voluntary changes in self-identification among increasingly Mon-Burmese bilingual populations in throughout Lower Burma.{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=202-206}} The shift was certainly accelerated by the fall of the Mon-speaking [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] in 1757. Following the fall of Pegu (now Bago), many Mon-speaking refugees fled and resettled in what is now modern-day Thailand.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wijeyewardene|first=Gehan|title=Ethnic Groups Across National Boundaries in Mainland Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-3035-57-7}}</ref> By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in the Lower Burma self-identified as Burmese-speaking Bamars; huge swaths of former Mon-speaking areas, from the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] upriver, spanning Bassein (now Pathein) and Rangoon (now Yangon) to Tharrawaddy, Toungoo, Prome (now Pyay) and Henzada (now Hinthada), were now Burmese-speaking.{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=202-206}} Great Britain's gradual annexation of Burma throughout the 19th century, in addition to concomitant economic and political instability in Upper Burma (e.g., increased tax burdens to the Burmese crown, British rice production incentives, etc.) also accelerated the migration of Burmese speakers from Upper Burma into Lower Burma.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adas|first=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Czd7xXIf3MC&pg=PA67|title=The Burma Delta: Economic Development and Social Change on an Asian Rice Frontier, 1852–1941|date=2011-04-20|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299283537|pages=67–77}}</ref>

While Thailand is home to a sizable Mon population due to historical waves of migration, only a small proportion (estimated to range between 60,000 to 80,000) speak Mon, due to [[Thaification]] and the assimilation of Mons into mainstream Thai society.<ref name=":3" /> Mon speakers in Thailand are largely concentrated in [[Ko Kret]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Brian L.|date=1973|title=Ethnic Identity of the Mons in Thailand|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_061_1i_Foster_EthnicIdentityOfMonsInThailand.pdf|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|volume=61|pages=203–226}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> The remaining contingent of Thai Mon speakers are located in the provinces of [[Samut Sakhon Province|Samut Sakhon]], [[Samut Songkhram Province|Samut Songkhram]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]], as well the western provinces bordering Myanmar ([[Kanchanaburi]], [[Phetchaburi]], [[Prachuap Khiri Khan]], and [[Ratchaburi]]).<ref name=":3" /> A small ethnic group in Thailand speak a language closely related to Mon, called [[Nyah Kur language|Nyah Kur]].

==Dialects==
Mon has three primary dialects in Burma, coming from the various regions the Mon inhabit. They are the Central (areas surrounding [[Mottama]] and [[Mawlamyine]]), [[Bago, Myanmar|Bago]], and [[Ye, Mon State|Ye]] dialects.<ref name=":3">{{cite book | last=South | first=Ashley | year=2003 | title=Mon Nationalism and Civil War in Burma: The Golden Sheldrake | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7007-1609-2 }}</ref> All are mutually intelligible. ''Ethnologue'' lists Mon dialects as Martaban-Moulmein (Central Mon, Mon Te), Pegu (Mon Tang, Northern Mon), and Ye (Mon Nya, Southern Mon), with high mutual intelligibility among them.

Thai Mon has some differences from the Burmese dialects of Mon, but they are mutually intelligible. The Thai varieties of Mon are considered "severely endangered."<ref name=":4" />

=== Vocalic register ===
Unlike the surrounding Burmese and [[Thai language|Thai]] languages, Mon is not a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. As in many Mon–Khmer languages, Mon uses a vowel-phonation or vowel-[[register (phonology)|register]] system in which the quality of voice in pronouncing the vowel is phonemic. There are two registers in Mon:

# Clear (modal) voice, analyzed by various linguists as ranging from ordinary to [[Creaky voice|creaky]]
# [[Breathy voice]], vowels have a distinct breathy quality

One study involving speakers of a Mon dialect in Thailand found that in some syllabic environments, words with a breathy voice vowel are significantly lower in pitch than similar words with a clear vowel counterpart.<ref name=thongkum>[[Theraphan Luangthongkum|Thongkum, Theraphan L]]. 1988. The interaction between pitch and phonation type in Mon: phonetic implications for a theory of tonogenesis. Mon-Khmer Studies 16-17:11-24.</ref> While difference in pitch in certain environments was found to be significant, there are no [[minimal pair]]s that are distinguished solely by pitch. The contrastive mechanism is the vowel phonation.

In the examples below, breathy voice is marked with under-diaeresis.

===Verbs and verb phrases===

Mon verbs do not inflect for person. Tense is shown through particles.

Some verbs have a morphological causative, which is most frequently a /pə-/ prefix (Pan Hla 1989:29):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Underived verb !! Gloss !! Causative verb !! Gloss
|-
| chɒt || to die || kəcɒt || to kill
|-
| lɜm || to be ruined || pəlɒm || to destroy
|-
| khaɨŋ || to be firm|| pəkhaɨŋ ||to make firm
|-
| tɛm || to know || pətɛm || to inform
|}

===Nouns and noun phrases===

====Singular and Plural====

Mon nouns do not inflect for number. That is, they do not have separate forms for singular and plural:

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{sɔt pakaw} mo̤a me̤a
|apple one CL
|'one apple'}}

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{sɔt pakaw} ba me̤a
|apple two CL
|'two apples'}}

====Adjectives====

Adjectives follow the noun (Pan Hla p.&nbsp;24):

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|prɛ̤a ce
|woman beautiful
|'beautiful woman'}}

====Demonstratives====

Demonstratives follow the noun:

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|ŋoa nɔʔ
|day this
|this day}}

====Classifiers====

Like many other Southeast Asian languages, Mon has [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] which are used when a noun appears with a numeral. The choice of classifier depends on the semantics of the noun involved.

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|kaneh mo̤a tanəng
|pen one CL
|'one pen'}}

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|chup mo̤a tanɒm
|tree one CL
|'one tree'}}

===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===

Mon is a prepositional language.

{{interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|doa əma
|in lake
|'in the lake'}}

===Sentences===

The ordinary word order for sentences in Mon is subject–verb–object, as in the following examples

{{fs interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{{my|အဲ}} {{my|ရာန်}} {{my|သ္ၚု}} {{my|တုဲ}} {{my|ယျ}}
|ʔoa ran hau toa ya.
|I buy rice COMPL AFF
|'I bought rice.'}}

{{fs interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{{my|ညး}} {{my|တံ}} {{my|ဗ္တောန်}} {{my|ကဵု}} {{my|အဲ}} {{my|ဘာသာ}} {{my|အၚ်္ဂလိက်}}
|Nyeh tɔʔ paton kɒ ʔua pʰɛ̤asa ʔengloit
|3 PL teach to 1 language English
|'They taught me English.'}}

===Questions===

Yes-no questions are shown with a final particle ''ha''

{{fs interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{{my|ဗှ်ေ}} {{my|စ}} {{my|ပုင်}} {{my|တုဲ}} {{my|ယျ}} {{my|ဟာ}}
|be̤ shea pəng toa ya ha?
|you eat rice COMPL AFF Q
|‘Have you eaten rice?’}}

{{fs interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{{my|အပါ}} {{my|အာ}} {{my|ဟာ}}
|əpa a ha?
|father go Q
|‘Will father go?’ (Pan Hla, p.&nbsp;42)}}

Wh-questions show a different final particle, ''rau''. The interrogative word does not undergo [[wh-movement]]. That is, it does not necessarily move to the front of the sentence:

{{fs interlinear|lang=my|indent=3
|{{my|တၠ  အဲ}} {{my|ကြာတ်ကြဴ}} {{my|မူ}} {{my|ရော}}
|{Tala oa} kratkraw mu raw?
|You wash what WHQ|abbreviations=WHQ:wh-question
|'What did you wash?'}}
