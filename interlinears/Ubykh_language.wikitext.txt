'''Ubykh''', or '''Ubyx''' (also known as '''Ubijé''' in Turkey, or '''Pekhi'''), is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian language]] once spoken by the [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] tribe of [[Circassians]] (who originally lived along the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] before being deported ''en masse'' to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] in the [[Circassian genocide]]).<ref name=Koerner1998>{{cite book |author=E.

The Ubykh language was [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]], with a high degree of [[agglutination]], with [[polypersonal agreement|polypersonal]] verbal agreement and a very large number of distinct [[consonant]]s but only two [[phoneme|phonemically distinct]] [[vowel]]s. With around eighty consonants, it had one of the largest inventories of consonants in the world,<ref>Charles King, The Ghost of Freedom (2008) p 15</ref> and the largest number for any language without [[click consonant|clicks]].

The name Ubykh is derived from {{lang|ady|Убыхыбзэ}} ({{IPA|/wəbəx/}}), its name in the Abdzakh [[Adyghe language]]. It is known in [[linguistics|linguistic]] literature by many names: variants of Ubykh, such as ''Ubikh'', {{lang|fr|Oubykh}} ([[French language|French]]); and ''Pekhi'' (from Ubykh {{IPA|/tʷaχə/}}) and its [[German language|German]]ised variant {{lang|de|Päkhy}}.

==Major features==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
Ubykh is distinguished by the following features, some of which are shared with other Northwest Caucasian languages:

* It is [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]], making no syntactic distinction between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] sentence and the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sentence. [[Split ergativity]] plays only a small part, if at all.
* It is highly [[Agglutination|agglutinating]] and [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]], using mainly monosyllabic or bisyllabic roots, but with single [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] words sometimes reaching nine or more syllables in length: {{IPA|/aχʲazbatɕʼaʁawdətʷaajlafaqʼajtʼmadaχ/}} ('if only you had not been able to make him take [it] all out from under me again for them'). [[Affix]]es rarely fuse in any way.
* It has a simple [[noun|nominal]] system, contrasting just three [[noun case]]s, and not always marking [[grammatical number]] in the direct case.
* Its system of [[Grammatical conjugation#Verbal agreement|verbal agreement]] is quite complex. English verbs must agree only with the subject; Ubykh verbs must agree with the subject, the direct object and the [[indirect object]], and [[benefactive]] objects must also be marked in the verb.
* It is [[phonology|phonologically]] complex as well, with 84 distinct [[consonant]]s (four of which, however, appear only in [[loan word]]s). According to some linguistic analyses, it only has two phonological vowels, but these vowels have a large range of [[allophone]]s because the range of consonants which surround them is so large.

== Phonology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
{{Main|Ubykh phonology}}
Ubykh has 84 phonemic consonants, a record high amongst languages without [[click consonants]], but only 2 phonemic vowels. Four of these consonants are found only in loanwords and [[onomatopoeiae]]. There are nine basic places of articulation for the consonants and extensive use of secondary articulation, such that Ubykh has 20 different [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] phonemes. Ubykh distinguishes three types of [[postalveolar consonant]]s: apical, laminal, and laminal closed. Regarding the vowels, since there are only two phonemic vowels, there is a great deal of allophony.

==Grammar==
=== Morphosyntax ===

Ubykh is agglutinative and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]: {{IPA|/ʃəkʲʼaajəfanamət/}} ('we will not be able to go back'), {{IPA|/awqʼaqʼajtʼba/}} ('if you had said it'). It is often extremely concise in its word forms.

The boundaries between nouns and verbs is somewhat blurred. Any noun can be used as the root of a stative verb ({{IPA|/məzə/}} 'child', {{IPA|/səməzəjtʼ/}} 'I was a child'), and many verb roots can become nouns simply by the use of noun affixes ({{IPA|/qʼa/}} 'to say', {{IPA|/səqʼa/}} 'what I say').<ref>Dumézil, G. 1975 Le verbe oubykh: études descriptives et comparatives (The Ubykh Verb: Descriptive and Comparative Studies). Paris: Imprimerie Nationale</ref><ref>Hewitt, B. G. 2005 North-West Caucasian. Lingua 115: 91-145.</ref>

==== Nouns ====
The noun system in Ubykh is quite simple. It has three noun cases (the oblique-ergative case may be two homophonous cases with differing function, thus presenting four cases in total):
* direct or [[absolutive case]], marked with the bare [[root (linguistics)|root]]; this indicates the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an intransitive sentence and the [[direct object]] of a transitive sentence (e.g. {{IPA|/tət/}} 'a man')
* oblique-[[ergative case]], marked in -{{IPA|/n/}}; this indicates either the subject of a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sentence, targets of [[preverb]]s, or [[indirect object]]s which do not take any other suffixes ({{IPA|/məzən/}} '(to) a child')
* [[locative case]], marked in -{{IPA|/ʁa/}}, which is the equivalent of English ''in'', ''on'' or ''at''.

The [[instrumental case]] (-{{IPA|/awn(ə)/}}) was also treated as a case in Dumézil (1975). Another pair of [[postposition]]s, -{{IPA|/laaq/}} ('to[wards]') and -{{IPA|/ʁaafa/}} ('for'), have been noted as synthetic [[dative]]s (e.g. {{IPA|/aχʲəlaaq astʷadaw/}} 'I will send it to the prince'), but their status as cases is also best discounted.

Nouns do not distinguish [[grammatical gender]]. The [[definite article]] is {{IPA|/a/}} (e.g. {{IPA|/atət/}} 'the man'). There is no [[indefinite article]] directly equivalent to the English ''a'' or ''an'', but {{IPA|/za/}}-(root)-{{IPA|/ɡʷara/}} (literally 'one'-(root)-'certain') translates French ''un'' : e.g. {{IPA|/zanajnʃʷɡʷara/}} ('a certain young man').

[[Number]] is only marked on the noun in the ergative case, with -{{IPA|/na/}}. The number marking of the absolutive argument is either by [[suppletion|suppletive]] verb roots (e.g. {{IPA|/akʷən blas/}} 'he is in the car' vs. {{IPA|/akʷən blaʒʷa/}} 'they are in the car') or by verb suffixes: {{IPA|/akʲʼan/}} ('he goes'), {{IPA|/akʲʼaan/}} ('they go'). The [[grammatical person|second person]] [[plural]] prefix {{IPA|/ɕʷ/}}- triggers this plural suffix regardless of whether that prefix represents the ergative, the absolutive, or an [[oblique argument]]: 
*Absolutive: {{IPA|/ɕʷastʷaan/}} ('I give you all to him')
*Oblique: {{IPA|/səɕʷəntʷaan/}} ('he gives me to you all')
*Ergative: {{IPA|/asəɕʷtʷaan/}}  ('you all give it/them to me')
Note that, in this last sentence, the plurality of ''it'' ({{IPA|/a/}}-) is obscured; the meaning can be either 'You all give ''it'' to me' or 'You all give ''them'' to me'.

[[Adjective]]s, in most cases, are simply suffixed to the noun: {{IPA|/tʃəbʒəja/}} ('pepper') with {{IPA|/pɬə/}} ('red') becomes {{IPA|/tʃəbʒəjapɬə/}} ('red pepper'). Adjectives do not [[declension|decline]].

[[Postposition]]s are rare; most locative [[semantics|semantic]] functions, as well as some non-local ones, are provided with [[preverb]]al elements: {{IPA|/asχʲawtxqʼa/}} ('you wrote it for me'). However, there are a few postpositions: {{IPA|/səʁʷa səɡʲaatɕʼ/}} ('like me'), {{IPA|/aχʲəlaaq/}} ('near the prince').

==== Verbs ====

A [[past tense|past]]{{ndash}}[[present tense|present]]{{ndash}}[[future tense|future]] distinction of verb [[Grammatical tense|tense]] exists (the suffixes -{{IPA|/qʼa/}} and -{{IPA|/awt/}} represent past and future) and an [[imperfective aspect]] suffix is also found (-{{IPA|/jtʼ/}}, which can combine with tense suffixes). Dynamic and stative verbs are contrasted, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and verbs have several [[gerund|nominal]] forms. Morphological [[causative]]s are not uncommon. The conjunctions {{IPA|/ɡʲə/}} ('and') and {{IPA|/ɡʲəla/}} ('but') are usually given with verb suffixes, but there is also a free particle corresponding to each:
*-{{IPA|/ɡʲə/}} 'and' (free particle {{IPA|/ve/}}, borrowed from Arabic);
*-{{IPA|/ɡʲəla/}} 'but' (free particle {{IPA|/aʁʷa/}})

Pronominal [[benefactive]]s are also part of the verbal complex, marked with the preverb {{IPA|/χʲa/}}-, but a benefactive cannot normally appear on a verb that has three agreement prefixes already.

[[Grammatical gender|Gender]] only appears as part of the [[grammatical person|second person]] paradigm, and then only at the speaker's discretion. The feminine second person index is {{IPA|/χa/}}-, which behaves like other pronominal prefixes: {{IPA|/wəsχʲantʷən/}} ('he gives [it] to you [normal; gender-neutral] for me'), but compare {{IPA|/χasχʲantʷən/}} 'he gives [it] to you [feminine] for me').

==== Adverbials ====
A few meanings covered in [[English language|English]] by [[adverb]]s or [[auxiliary verb]]s are given in Ubykh by verb suffixes:

*{{IPA|/asfəpχa/}} ('I need to drink it')
*{{IPA|/asfəfan/}} ('I can drink it')
*{{IPA|/asfəɡʲan/}} ('I drink it all the time')
*{{IPA|/asfəlan/}} ('I am drinking it all up')
*{{IPA|/asfətɕʷan/}} ('I drink it too much')
*{{IPA|/asfaajən/}} ('I drink it again')

==== Questions ====
[[Question]]s may be marked grammatically, using verb suffixes or prefixes:

*Yes{{ndash}}no questions with -{{IPA|/ɕ/}}: {{IPA|/wana awbjaqʼaɕ/}}? ('did you see that?')
*Complex questions with -{{IPA|/j/}}: {{IPA|/saakʲʼa wəpʼtsʼaj/}}? ('what is your name?')

Other types of questions, involving the pronouns 'where' and 'what', may also be marked only in the verbal complex: {{IPA|/maawkʲʼanəj/}} ('where are you going?'), {{IPA|/saawqʼaqʼajtʼəj/}} ('what had you said?').

==== Preverbs and determinants ====
Many local, prepositional, and other functions are provided by [[preverb]]al elements providing a large series of [[applicative voice|applicative]]s, and here Ubykh shows remarkable complexity. Two main types of preverbal elements exist: determinants and preverbs. The number of preverbs is limited, and mainly show [[Location (geography)|location]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]. The number of determinants is also limited, but the class is more [[open class word|open]]; some determinant prefixes include {{IPA|/tʃa/}}- ('with regard to a horse') and {{IPA|/ɬa/}}- ('with regard to the foot or base of an object').

For simple locations, there are a number of possibilities that can be encoded with preverbs, including (but not limited to):
* above and touching
* above and not touching
* below and touching
* below and not touching
* at the side of
* through a space
* through solid matter
* on a flat horizontal surface
* on a non-horizontal or vertical surface
* in a homogeneous mass
* towards
* in an upward direction
* in a downward direction
* into a tubular space
* into an enclosed space
There is also a separate directional preverb meaning 'towards the speaker': {{IPA|/j/}}-, which occupies a separate slot in the verbal complex. However, preverbs can have meanings that would take up entire phrases in English. The preverb {{IPA|/jtɕʷʼaa/}}- signifies 'on the earth' or 'in the earth', for instance: {{IPA|/ʁadja ajtɕʷʼaanaaɬqʼa/}} ('they buried his body'; literally, "they put his body in the earth"). Even more narrowly, the preverb {{IPA|/faa/}}- signifies that an action is done out of, into or with regard to a fire: {{IPA|/amdʒan zatʃətʃaqʲa faastχʷən/}} ('I take a brand out of the fire').

== Orthography ==
Writing systems for the Ubykh language have been proposed,<ref name="fenwick">{{cite book|last=Fenwick|first=R. S. H.|title=A Grammar of Ubykh|year=2011|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich}}</ref> but there has never been a standard written form.

== Lexicon ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}

=== Native vocabulary ===
Ubykh [[syllable]]s have a strong tendency to be CV, although VC and CVC also exist. [[Consonant cluster]]s are not as large as in Abzhywa [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] or in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], rarely being larger than two terms. Three-term clusters exist in two words - {{IPA|/ndʁa/}} ('sun') and {{IPA|/psta/}} ('to swell up'), but the latter is a loan from Adyghe, and the former more often pronounced {{IPA|/nədʁa/}} when it appears alone.
[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] plays a large part in Ubykh and, indeed, in all Northwest Caucasian [[semantics]]. There is no verb equivalent to English ''to love'', for instance; one says "I love you" as {{IPA|/tʂʼanə wəzbjan/}} ('I see you well').

[[Reduplication]] occurs in some roots, often those with [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] values ({{IPA|/χˤaχˤa/}}, 'to curry[comb]' from {{IPA|/χˤa/}} 'to scrape'; {{IPA|/kʼərkʼər/}}, 'to cluck like a chicken' [a loan from Adyghe]); and {{IPA|/warqwarq/}}, 'to croak like a frog').

Roots and affixes can be as small as one phoneme. The word {{IPA|/wantʷaan/}}, 'they give you to him', for instance, contains six phonemes, each a separate morpheme:

*{{IPA|/w/}} - 2nd singular absolutive
*{{IPA|/a/}} - 3rd singular dative
*{{IPA|/n/}} - 3rd ergative
*{{IPA|/tʷ/}} - to give
*{{IPA|/aa/}} - ergative plural
*{{IPA|/n/}} - present tense

However, some words may be as long as seven [[syllable]]s (although these are usually compounds): {{IPA|/ʂəqʷʼawəɕaɬaadətʃa/}} ('staircase').

=== Slang and idioms ===
As with all other languages, Ubykh is replete with [[idiom]]s. The word {{IPA|/ntʷa/}} ('door'), for instance, is an idiom meaning either "magistrate", "court", or "government." However, idiomatic constructions are even more common in Ubykh than in most other languages; the representation of abstract ideas with series of concrete elements is a characteristic of the Northwest Caucasian family. As mentioned above, the phrase meaning "I love you" translates literally as 'I see you well'; similarly, "you please me" is literally 'you cut my heart'. The term {{IPA|/wərəs/}} ('Russian'), an Arabic loan, has come to be a slang term meaning "infidel", "non-Muslim" or "enemy" (see [[#History|History]] below).

=== Foreign loans ===
The majority of loanwords in Ubykh are derived from either [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]], with smaller numbers from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], and the [[South Caucasian languages]]. Towards the end of Ubykh's life, a large influx of Adyghe words was noted; Vogt (1963) notes a few hundred examples. The phonemes {{IPA|/ɡ/ /k/ /kʼ/}} were borrowed from Arabic and Adyghe. {{IPA|/ɬʼ/}} also appears to come from Adyghe, although it seems to have arrived earlier on. It is possible, too, that {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is a loan from Adyghe, since most of the few words with this phoneme are obvious Adyghe loans: {{IPA|/paaɣa/}} ('proud'), {{IPA|/ɣa/}} ('testis').

Many loanwords have Ubykh equivalents, but were dwindling in usage under the influence of Arabic, Circassian, and Russian equivalents:
* {{IPA|/bərwə/}} ('to make a hole in, to perforate' from Iranic languages) = {{IPA|/pɕaatχʷ/}}
* {{IPA|/tʃaaj/}} ('tea' from Chinese) = {{IPA|/bzəpɕə/}}
* {{IPA|/wərəs/}} ('enemy' from Persian) = {{IPA|/bˤaqˤʼa/}}

Some words, usually much older ones, are borrowed from less influential stock: Colarusso (1994) sees {{IPA|/χˤʷa/}} ('pig') as a borrowing from a proto-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] *''huka'', and {{IPA|/aɡʲarə/}} ('slave') from an [[Iranian language|Iranian]] root; however, Chirikba (1986) regards the latter as being of Abkhaz origin ( ← Abkhaz ''agər-wa'' 'lower cast of peasants; slave', literally 'Megrelian').

== Evolution ==

In the scheme of Northwest Caucasian evolution, despite its parallels with Adyghe and Abkhaz, Ubykh forms a separate third branch of the family. It has fossilised palatal class markers where all other Northwest Caucasian languages preserve traces of an original labial class: the Ubykh word for 'heart', {{IPA|/ɡʲə/}}, corresponds to the reflex {{IPA|/ɡʷə/}} in Abkhaz, Abaza, Adyghe, and Kabardian. Ubykh also possesses groups of pharyngealised consonants. All other NWC languages possess true pharyngeal consonants, but Ubykh is the only language to use pharyngealisation as a feature of secondary articulation.

With regard to the other languages of the family, Ubykh is closer to Adyghe and Kabardian{{Contradict-inline|article=Abkhaz language#Classification|date=June 2013}} but shares many features with Abkhaz due to geographic influence;<!-- how so? Ubykh was not spoken in Abkhazia --> many later Ubykh speakers were bilingual in Ubykh and Adyghe.<!-- this actually suggests that [[Abkhaz language#Classification]] is right and that it is the other way round: Bilinguality suggests geographical/areal contact influence from Adyghe, rather than Abkhaz, which wasn't spoken in the same area, after all -->

=== Dialects ===
While not many dialects of Ubykh existed, one divergent [[dialect]] of Ubykh has been noted (in Dumézil 1965:266-269). Grammatically, it is similar to standard Ubykh (i.e. [[Tevfik Esenç]]'s dialect), but has a very different sound system, which had collapsed into just 62-odd phonemes:
* {{IPA|/dʷ/ /tʷ/ /tʷʼ/}} have collapsed into {{IPA|/b/ /p/ /pʼ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɕʷ/ /ʑʷ/}} are indistinguishable from {{IPA|/ʃʷ/ /ʒʷ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}} seems to have disappeared.
* Pharyngealisation is no longer distinctive, having been replaced in many cases by [[geminate]] consonants.
* Palatalisation of the uvular consonants is no longer phonemic.

== History ==
Ubykh was spoken in the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] around [[Sochi]] until 1864, when the Ubykhs were driven out of the region by the [[Russia]]ns. They eventually came to settle in [[Turkey]], founding the villages of [[Hacı Osman]], [[Kırkpınar (village)|Kırkpınar]], Masukiye and [[Hacı Yakup]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Circassian language|Circassian]] eventually became the preferred languages for everyday communication, and many words from these languages entered Ubykh in that period.

The Ubykh language [[extinct language|died out]] on 7 October 1992, when its last fluent speaker, [[Tevfik Esenç]], died.<ref name=Koerner1998/> Before his death, thousands of pages of material and many audio recordings had been collected and collated by a number of linguists, including [[Georges Charachidzé]], [[Georges Dumézil]], [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]], [[George Hewitt (linguist)|George Hewitt]] and [[A. Sumru Özsoy]], with the help of some of its last speakers, particularly Tevfik Esenç and [[Huseyin Kozan]].<ref name=Koerner1998/> Ubykh was never [[written language|written]] by its speech community, but a few phrases were transcribed by [[Evliya Celebi]] in his [[Seyahatname]] and a substantial portion of the oral literature, along with some cycles of the [[Nart saga]], was transcribed. Tevfik Esenç also eventually learned to write Ubykh in the transcription that Dumézil devised.

[[Julius von Mészáros]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] linguist, visited Turkey in 1930 and took down some notes on Ubykh. His work ''[[Die Päkhy-Sprache]]'' was extensive and accurate to the extent allowed by his transcription system (which could not represent all the phonemes of Ubykh) and marked the foundation of Ubykh linguistics.

The [[France|Frenchman]] [[Georges Dumézil]] also visited Turkey in 1930 to record some Ubykh and would eventually become the most celebrated Ubykh linguist. He published a collection of Ubykh folktales in the late 1950s, and the language soon attracted the attention of linguists for its small number of phonemic vowels. [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]], produced a monumental [[dictionary]] that, in spite of its many errors (later corrected by Dumézil), is still one of the masterpieces and essential tools of Ubykh linguistics.

Later in the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Dumézil published a series of papers on Ubykh [[etymology]] in particular and Northwest Caucasian etymology in general. Dumézil's book ''Le Verbe Oubykh'' (1975), a comprehensive account of the verbal and nominal morphology of the language, is another cornerstone of Ubykh linguistics.

Since the 1980s, Ubykh [[linguistics]] has slowed drastically. No other major treatises have been published; however, the Dutch linguist [[Rieks Smeets]] is currently trying to compile a new Ubykh dictionary based on Vogt's 1963 book, and a similar project is also underway in Australia. The Ubykh themselves have shown interest in relearning their language.

The Abkhaz writer [[Bagrat Shinkuba]]'s historical novel [http://www.circassianlibrary.org/lib/html/Shinkuba-The_Last_of_the_Departed/contents.html Bagrat Shinkuba. ''The Last of the Departed''] treats the fate of the Ubykh people.

People who have published literature on Ubykh include
* [[Brian George Hewitt]]
* Brian Fell
* Catherine Paris
* Christine Leroy
* Georg Bossong
* [[Georges Dumézil]]
* [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]]
* [[John Colarusso]]
* Julius von Mészáros
* Rieks Smeets
* Rhona (formerly Rohan) Fenwick
* [[Tevfik Esenç]]
* [[Viacheslav Chirikba]]
* Wim Lucassen

===Notable characteristics===
Ubykh had been cited in the ''Guinness Book of Records'' (1996 ed.) as the language with the most consonant [[phoneme]]s, but since 2017 the [[Taa language|!Xóõ language]] (a member of the Tuu languages) has been considered by the book to have broken that record, with 130 consonants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Language with most consonants|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67421-language-with-most-consonants|access-date=2021-07-29|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB}}</ref> Ubykh has 20 [[uvular consonant|uvular]] and 29 pure [[fricative]] phonemes, more than any other known language.
