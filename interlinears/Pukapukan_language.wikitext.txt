'''Pukapukan''' is a [[Polynesian language]] that developed in isolation on the island of [[Pukapuka]] in the [[Northern Cook Islands|northern group]] of the [[Cook Islands]]. As a "Samoic Outlier" language with strong links to western Polynesia, Pukapukan is not closely related to any other languages of the Cook Islands, but does manifest substantial borrowing from some East Polynesian source in antiquity.

Recent research suggests that the languages of Pukapuka, [[Tokelauan language|Tokelau]] and [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvalu]] group together as a cluster, and as such had significant influence on several of the Polynesian Outliers, such as [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]], [[Pileni]], [[Sikaiana]] (all in the [[Solomon Islands]]) and the [[Takuu Atoll]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. There is also evidence that Pukapuka had prehistoric contact with Micronesia, as there are quite a number of words in Pukapukan that appear to be borrowings from [[Kiribati language|Kiribati]] (K. & M. Salisbury conference paper, 2013).

Pukapukan is also known as "te leo Wale" ('the language of Home') in reference to the name of the northern islet where the people live. The atoll population has declined from some 750 in the early 1990s to less than 500 since the cyclone in 2005. Literacy in the Pukapukan language was introduced in the school in the 1980s, resulting in an improvement in the quality of education on the atoll.

The majority of those speaking the language live in a number of migrant communities in New Zealand and Australia. A bilingual dictionary was started by the school teachers on the island and completed in Auckland within the Pukapukan community there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Briar |title=Pukapuka dictionary goes live |url=http://www.cookislandsnews.com/item/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live |access-date=3 May 2019 |work=Cook Islands News |date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Te Pukamuna - Pukapuka Dictionary |url=https://pukapuka.world/dictionary |access-date=3 May 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> An indepth study of the language has resulted in a reference grammar (Mary Salisbury, A Grammar of Pukapukan, University of Auckland, 2003 700pp.).
The most significant publication in the Pukapuka language will be the "Puka Yā" (Bible), with the New Testament expected to be completed for publishing in 2019.

==History==
Pukapukan is the language spoken on the coral atoll of Pukapuka, located in the northern section of the Cook Islands (Beaglehole 1906–1965). Pukapukan shares minor intelligibility with its national language of Cook Islands Maori, and bears strong links to its neighboring Western Polynesian cultures specifically Samoa.
The island of Pukapuka is one of the most remote islands in the Cook Islands. There is evidence that humans have inhabited the atoll for about 2000 years, but it is not clear whether it has been continuously inhabited. It may be certain that a final settlement took place around 1300 AD from Western Polynesia. Local oral tradition records that huge waves generated by a severe cyclone washed over the island and killed most of the inhabitants except for 15–17 men, 2 women and an unknown number of children. Recent interpretation of genealogies suggests that this catastrophe occurred about 1700 AD. It was from these survivors that the island was repopulated.

The island was one of the first of the Cook Islands to be discovered by the Europeans, on Sunday 20 August 1595 by the Spanish Explorer [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]].

===Population===
The language of Pukapukan is not only spoken on the island of Pukapuka but on the neighboring Cook Islands as well as New Zealand and Australia. Today the population of Pukapuka has diminished with only a few hundred native speakers. From a 2001 census there were only about 644 speakers on Pukapuka and its plantation island of Nassau. As of a 2011 census, there are now only 450 speakers due to a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Pukapuka in 2005. There are a total of 2,400 speakers worldwide, including those who live on Pukapuka and the 200 speakers on [[Rarotonga]], the most populous island of the Cook Islands.

===Classification===
Pukapukan is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] of the [[Nuclear Polynesian languages|Nuclear Polynesian]] branch.<ref>Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds. (2020). "[https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/puka1242 Pukapuka]". ''[[Glottolog|Glottolog 4.2.1]]''. Jena, Germany: Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.</ref> Though grouped with the Cook Islands the language shows influence from both Eastern and Western Polynesia.

==Phonology==

===Alphabet===
There are 15 letters in the Pukapukan alphabet – five vowels and 10 consonants. The [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|ng}} occurs in the place that {{angbr|G}} occupies in the English alphabet.
{{angbr|a, e, ng, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, u, v, w, y}}

===Consonants===
The consonant phonemes in Pukapukan are: {{IPA|/ p, t, k, v, w, θ, m, n, ŋ, l /}} (Teingoa 1993).

The letters {{angbr|y}} and {{angbr|w}} are not in the Cook Islands Maori language but are additions to Pukapukan. The semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} and the palatalised dental spirant {{IPA|/θʲ/}}, in general, regularly reflect  *f and *s, respectively. The {{angbr|y}} sound in Pukapukan actually acts somewhat differently and is difficult for non native speakers to pronounce. It is pronounced like {{angbr|th}} in English "this, other".

*{{lang|pkp|wano}}, go
*{{lang|pkp|wou}}, new
*{{lang|pkp|wawine}}, woman
*{{lang|pkp|yinga}}, fall over
*{{lang|pkp|iyu}}, nose
*{{lang|pkp|tayi}}, one

===Vowels===
The vowels in Pukapukan are respectively {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. All vowels have two sounds, a long sound and a short sound. A vowel's length is indicated by writing a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] above each vowel.

*{{lang|pkp|papa}}, rock
*{{lang|pkp|papā}}, European
*{{lang|pkp|pāpā}}, father
*{{lang|pkp|pāpa}}, crewcut (hairstyle)

In Pukapukan it is safe to say that every syllable ends with a vowel, every vowel is pronounced, and there are no [[diphthong]]al sounds.

==Grammar==

===Basic word order===
Pukapukan uses the two distinctive word orders of [[Verb–subject–object|verb-subject-object]] and Verb-Object-Subject, although it is clear that VSO is used more commonly. Adjectives always follow their nouns in Pukapukan. ''Waka-'' is often used as a causative prefix in Austronesian languages, but in Pukapukan it has various functionalities. Due to Rarotongan influence ‘waka-’ is shortened to ‘aka-’, whereas ‘waka-’ is seen to be more formal (Teingoa 1993).
Nouns prefixed by waka- become verbs with similar meanings:
*au, peace; waka-au, to make peace
*lā, sun; waka-lā, to put in the sun to dry
*ela; wedge; wakaela, to wedge

Adjectives prefixed by waka become transitive verbs:
*yako, straight; waka-yako, to straighten
*kokoi, sharp; waka-kokoi, to sharpen

Some verbs prefixed by waka- have specialized meanings that become somewhat difficult to predict from the base meaning.
*yā, sacred; waka-yā, to observe as sacred
*pono, to be sure; waka-pono, to decide to finalize

===Reduplication===
Like many other Polynesian languages, Pukapukan uses a lot of full and partial reduplication, some times to emphasize a word or to give it new meaning.
*kale, wave/surf; kale-le, undertow of the sea (waves coming in and others receding)
*kapa, to clap hands in rhythm; kapa-kapa, to flutter

===Numerals===
# tayi “one”
# lua “two”
# tolu “three”
# wa “four”
# lima “five”
# ono “six”
# witu “seven”
# valu “eight”
# iva “nine”
# katoa/laungaulu “ten”

Pukapukan uses two different counting systems in the language; the ‘one unit’ and the ‘two unit’. Numeral classifiers are also used as prefixes for numbers over ten and different objects.
The ‘one unit’ uses its word for ten ‘laungaulu’ and adds the ‘one unit’ number (Teingoa 1993).
*18 - laungaulu ma valu (ten and eight)

For numbers above nineteen the single unit numbers are used.
*30 - lau tolu (two three)
*40 - lau wa (two four)

The ‘two unit’ is derived from the ‘one unit’.

=== Demonstratives and Spatial Deictics ===

==== Different form classes ====

===== Demonstrative pronouns =====
Much like other Oceanic languages, Pukapukan has a three-way distinction of positional demonstrative particles that relate to the position of the speaker and addressee.<ref>Lynch, J., Ross, M., & Crowley, T. (2002). ''The Oceanic Languages''. Richmond UK: Curzon. p. 38</ref> In Pukapukan, these include ''nei'' ‘near to the speaker,’ ''nā'' ‘near to addressee and ''lā'' ‘away from both the speaker and addressee.’ Pukapukan also has the demonstrative particle ''ia'' meaning ‘aforementioned.’ <ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf. p. 261</ref> These demonstrative particles form compounds with the singular articles ''te'' and ''e'' and with the preposition ''ki'' ‘to.’ <ref name=":0">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf. p. 205</ref>

The definite [[demonstrative]] pronouns are formed by adding the singular specific article ''te-''. For example, when adding ''te-'', ''nei'' becomes ''tēnei'' ‘this (by me),’ ''nā'' becomes ''tēnā'' ‘that (by you),’ ''lā'' becomes ''tēlā'' ‘that (over there)’ and ''ia'' becomes ''teia'' ‘this (being demonstrated or mentioned previously).’ These demonstrative pronouns only occur as subjects of nominal [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] and as represented below can be equated with personal pronouns (example 1), pronouns (examples 2–3) or definite common noun phrases (examples 4–5).<ref name=":0" />

{{interlinear|number=(1)
|Ko oku '''tenei''' ko Vakayala.
|PRD I this PRD Vakayala
|This is me, Vakayala.}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|Ko koe koia '''tēnā''' na langaina toku kongá?
|PRD you exactly that TAM uproot-CIA my place-DA
|Was that indeed you who uprooted my garden?}}

{{interlinear|number=(3)
|Ko ai '''tēlā''' e yaelé.
|PRD ANAPH.PN that TAM walk-DA
|Who is that walking over there?}}

{{interlinear|number=(4)
|Ko tona '''teina''' teia.
|PRD his brother this
|This is his brother.}}

{{interlinear|number=(5)
|Ko te lili '''teia''' o te wī lōpā.
|PRD ART anger this POSS ART all youth
|This was [why] all the youths were angry.}}

The demonstrative subject may separate the head from the possessive phase when the nominal predicate is a [[Phrase|complex phrase]] whose head is modified by a postposed possessive phrase, as shown in example 6 below. <ref name=":1">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 206</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(6)
|Ko te kau '''teia''' o tona vaka
|TOP ART group here POSS his canoe 
|These are the people belonging to his canoe.}}

The nonspecific article ''e'' and the positional demonstrative particles can also be combined to form indefinite demonstrative pronouns. These include ''ēnāi'' ‘this (by me),’ ''ēnā'' ‘that (by you),’ ''ēlā ‘''that (over there)’ and ''eia'' ‘here with (being demonstrated).’ These demonstrative pronouns constitute the nucleus of indefinite nominal predicates and are normally followed by their subjects as shown in examples 7&ndash;10 below.<ref name=":1">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 206</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(7)
|'''Ēnāi''' toku manako, ka wō t''āua'' ki te keonga, tunu i a tāua manu nei.
|This my thought TAM go.PL we.DU G ART point cook ACC POSS we.DU bird here
|This is my idea, let's go to the point and cook our birds.}}

{{interlinear|number=(8)
|'''Ēnā''' ake te puká.
|that DIR ART book-{{gcl|Da|definitive accent}}
|Please pass that book there.}}

{{interlinear|number=(9)
|'''Ēlā''' te weke koa lele ki loto o te pū.
|that ART octopus TAM run G inside POSS ART hole
|Over there's an octopus fleeing to his hole.}}

{{interlinear|number=(10)
|'''Eia''' tau kapu kaope.
|here.with your cup coffee
|Here is your cup of coffee [handing it over]}}

The demonstrative particles can also form compounds with the preposition ''ki-'' ‘to.’ These compounds can be used as a substitute ([[pro-form]]) for locational nouns. These type of demonstrative pronouns in Pukapukan include, ''kinea'' ‘to here,’ ''kinā ‘''to there, by you,’ ''kilā'' ‘to over there’ and ''kiai'' ‘to there,’ in which ''kiai'' is an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] form.<ref name=":2">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 202</ref>

These demonstrative pronouns occur as the head of a locative predicate as demonstrated in examples 11&ndash;13 below. <ref name=":2" />

The compound ''kiai'' is formed by joining the case marker ''ki'' (meaning ‘to’) to the anaphoric pronoun ''ai''. ''Kiai'' may replace a personal pronoun or a proper locational noun. This can be seen in example 13 in which the locational noun ''wale'' ‘home’ is replaced with ''kiai'' in the following constituent. <ref name=":2" />  

{{interlinear|number=(11)
|Nā i '''kinei''' oki te tele i te taime ia.
|TAM LOC here also ART tour.group LOC ART time AF
|The tour group was here at that time.}}

{{interlinear|number=(12)
|Ko i '''kinā''' mō ia Kalaka ma Pilipa.
|TAM LOC there Q ART Kalaka and Pilipa
|Kalaka and Pilipa are where you are, aren't they?}}

{{interlinear|number=(13)
|Angatu atu au ki wale, ko i '''kiai''' ia Pāpā mā.
|go DIR I G home TAM LOC there ART Father etc.
|When I got home, Father and the others were there.}}

These forms can also be used to substitute a noun phrase which has been marked for case by a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]]. For example:<ref name=":2" />

{{interlinear|number=(14)
|Ka lōmamai ai ia Ngake ki '''kinei''' angaanga.
|TAM come.PL ANAPH.PN ART Ngake G here REDUP-work
|The whole of Ngake will come here to work.}}

{{interlinear|number=(15)
|Ko te tokatolu lā '''kilā'''
|PRD ART PRE-three over there
|The three of them over there.}}

===== Demonstrative modifiers =====
Pukapukan has several classes of [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]].<ref name=":4">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 235</ref> In particular, the directional and positional modifiers help indicate spatial and temporal directions and positions from the speaker and/or addressee.<ref name=":4" />

{| class="wikitable"
|+Directionals <ref name=":5">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 235</ref>
|mai
|'towards speaker'
|-
|atu
|'away from speaker'
|-
|ake
|'upwards,' 'oblique to speaker'; 'please'
|-
|io
|'?downwards,' 'misfortune'
|}

According to Clark (1976),<ref>Clark, Ross. (1976). Aspects of Proto-Polynesian syntax. Te Reo Monograph. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand</ref> [[cognate]]s of the directional particles of Pukapukan are found in all Polynesian languages.

The directional particles tend to modify verbs more frequently than nouns and are often associated with verbs that denote movement, as well as verbs that denote speech, perception, cognition and social interaction.<ref name=":6">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 241</ref>

'''''Mai''''' indicates real or implied movement in the direction of the speaker, for example:<ref name=":7">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 242</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(16)
|Teketeke '''mai''' kai aku nei.
|REDUP-move DIR G-ART I here
|Move a little closer to me.}}

{{interlinear|number=(17)
|Auwē koe e tāpitāpi '''mai''', ka yuyū toku kākawu.
|NEG.IMP you TAM sprinkle DIR TAM wet my clothes.
|Don't splash water on me in case my clothes get wet.}}

'''''Atu''''' can indicate physical movement away from the speaker, as in:<ref name=":7" />

{{interlinear|number=(18)
|Yoloyolo '''atu''' koe ki te toe kaokao.
|REDUP-move DIR you G ART other side
|Move away from me to the other side.}}

and for verbs of perception and communication can also indicate direction away from the deictic centre, for example:<ref name=":7" />

{{interlinear|number=(19)
|Ko tātā '''atu''' iāna kia koe?
|TAM write DIR he G-ART you
|Does he write to you?}}

''Atu'' can also encode temporal progression away from the present.<ref name=":7" />

{{interlinear|number=(20)
|Wea '''atu''' ai koe?
|what DIR ANAPH.PN you
|What did you do then?}}

''Mai'' and ''atu'' can co-occur when modifying the same verb, when one has a directional meaning and the other has a temporal or [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] meaning.<ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 246</ref>

'''''Ake''''' mostly functions as a politeness marker, but the directional particle ''ake'' now has meanings 'upwards' and 'oblique to speaker,' which appears to be a one-particle combination of [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]]'s ''hake'' 'upwards' and ''aŋe'' 'oblique to speaker.'<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":8">Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 247</ref> Hence, it can function similar to ''atu'' and ''mai'' in term of denoting temporal and aspectual meanings. However, these forms are rarely used in present day.<ref name=":8" />

In saying that, '''''io''''' is found to be used even less. Reflexes of its Proto-Polynesian form have traditionally been glossed 'downwards,' but this meaning is hardly apparent in Pukapukan and is more often associated with meaning 'misfortune coming upon one.'<ref name=":8" />

{| class="wikitable"
|+Positionals<ref name=":5" />
|nei
|'near to speaker'
|-
|nā
|'near to addressee'
|-
|lā
|'away from both, 'intensifier'
|-
| -V
|definitive accent: 'away from both'
|-
|ia
|'aforementioned'
|}

The positional modifiers indicate location in space or time relative to the speaker or to the deictic centre of the discourse.

'''''Nei''''' 'near to speaker' can modify a noun in a noun phrase or a locative phrase. Doing so indicates that the entity encoded by the noun is within sight of or in the general locality of the speaker. For instance, in example 21 below, the speaker is likely pointing to a 'word' near them while asking the question.<ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 261</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(21)
|E wea te ingoa '''nei'''?
|PRD what ART name here
|What is this word?}}

'''''Nā''''' 'near to addressee' only occurs in noun phrases and can denote a position near to the addressee (example 22), something belonging to the addressee or a characteristic behavior pattern or inherent quality of the addressee (example 23) or, in long-distance communication ''nā'' can indicate that the addressee is anticipated to be in a certain place at the time of reading the letter or story or answering the phone call during the long-distance communication (example 24).<ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 263</ref>

{{interlinear|number=(22)
|Aumai ake taku pāla '''nā'''.
|bring DIR my knife there
|Please pass my knife [that you have].}}

{{interlinear|number=(23)
|Kokoto ake tā kōtou īmene '''nā''' ke langona.
|R-grunt DIR POSS you song there C hear
|Please start your song so [we] can hear [it].}}

{{interlinear|number=(24)
|Auwā ko lelei wua kōtou i Wale '''nā'''.
|probably TAM good just you LOC home there.
|I hope you are all well there in Pukapuka [where you are].}}

'''''Lā''''' 'away from both speaker and addressee; intensifier' may only occur with a directional meaning in verb phrases, not in noun phrases. ''Lā'' often modifies motion verbs and can take on the directional meaning of 'there, yonder.'<ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 275</ref> For example:

{{interlinear|number=(25)
|Luku '''lā''' koe ki te watu.
|dive there you G ART stone
|Dive down to the rock.}}

===== Demonstrative predicates =====
In Pukapukan, demonstrative predicates take on a number of roles and functions.

Firstly, indefinite demonstrative pronouns can function as predicates which denote spatial or temporal location and are usually followed by their subjects as demonstrated in examples 7-10 above.<ref>Salisbury, M. C. (2002). A Grammar of Pukapukan. <nowiki>http://pukapuka.world/archive/Pukapukan-Grammar_Web.pdf</nowiki>. p. 343</ref> 

When denoting temporal location, demonstrative predicates may do this specifically (as in example 26) or indirectly (as in example 27). 

{{interlinear|number=(26)
|'''Ēnei''' loa te taime ko velavela. 
|here INT ART time TAM RR-hot
|This is really the time when [the food] is hot.}}

{{interlinear|number=(27)
|Kalia wua, '''ēnei''' na pau.
|wait-CIA just here TAM finish
|Just wait, [I'm nearly] finished.}}

In narratives, demonstrative predicates may be used to set the scene for an imminent event, such as:

{{interlinear|number=(28)
|'''Ēnei''' iki nā vaka
|here carry ART canoe
|Here [they were] carrying the canoes.}}

They may also function as an affirmation seeker or used to describe or explain an aside in real time to listeners and readers.  

{{interlinear|number=(29)
|'''Ēnei,''' na tiketike ai te langi ki lunga nei.
|here TAM RR-high PRO ART sky G up here
|Thus, the sky is high up above.}}

{{interlinear|number=(30)
|'''Ēlā,''' ko te tangata na uwiuwia na pulú, ko Tepou.
|there TOP ART person TAM RR-cover-CIA ART husk-DA, PRD Tepou
|You know, that person who was turning over those husks, it was Tepou.}}

In particular, ''eia'' can be used to set apart narrative clauses from backgrounding comments and is also used as a marker which concludes a narrative. 

{{interlinear|number=(31)
|'''Eia,''' Kave loe lā oki lātou ia Uyo ma tana lau.
|so take INT INT also they ART Uyo and his men
|So, then they took Uyo and his men.}}

{{interlinear|number=(32)
|'''Eia,''' pau atu ai taku tala ia.
|so finish DIR PRO my story AF
|So, that's the end of my story.}}

Lastly, demonstrative predicates do not allow [[Topic and comment|topicalisation]] of their subjects. 

{{interlinear|number=(33)
|*Te''',''' puka '''ēnei.'''
|ART book here
|(Here is the book).}}

===== Demonstrative adverbs =====
Pukapukan has four demonstrative adverbs. These include ''pēnei'' ‘like this,’ ''pēnā'' ‘like that [by you],’ ''p''ē''lā'' ‘like that [over there]’ ''and peia'' ‘like so [being demonstrated]’ can modify a predicate, function as verbs, denote modality, introduce direct or indirect speech or stand as a pro-form for a prepositional phrase. For example, ''peia'' functions as a verb meaning ‘carry on in like manner’ to the action or state described in a previous clause as seen in example 34 below. 

{{interlinear|number=(34)
|[Nō kiai kake loa iāna i te niu mua], [kake i te lua], [pēia wua ai], [oko ki te niu openga].
|POSS that climb INT he ACC ART coconut first climb ACC ART second like-so just PRO arrive G ART coconut last
|So he climbed the first coconut, climbed the second, and carried on like that [until he] got to the last coconut.}}

===Loanwords===
Pukapukan is not closely related to other Cook Islands languages but it does show substantial borrowing from Eastern Polynesian languages, such as Rarotongan. In fact, because there is no ‘r’ in Pukapukan ‘l’ takes its place in Rarotongan borrowings (Teingoa 1993).

===Materials===
There is a limited list when it comes to the language of Pukapukan. Although, today speakers of the language, locals of Pukapuka, and especially teachers on the island are working to put together books and resources dedicated to the teaching and structure of Pukapukan. Collaboratively the locals  of the island are also working to bring back to their own community since the devastating Cyclone Percy in 2005. Since 2005 it has taken nearly 6 years to rebuild their communities (Pasifika 2009). Currently there are a select number of manuscripts and dictionaries on the language of Pukapukan, but their culture is kept alive through music and dance collaborations across the pacific and websites like YouTube.

===Vitality===
According to [[Ethnologue]] Pukapukan is considered to be a threatened language and its “Intergenerational transmission is in the process of being broken, but the child-bearing generation can still use the language so it is possible that revitalization efforts could restore transmission of the language in the home.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pukapukan|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/pkp|access-date=11 June 2020|website=Ethnologue}}</ref> Speakers of Pukapukan especially children are multilingual in English and Cook Islands Maori, but English is rarely spoken outside of schools and many classes are actually taught in Pukapukan. Today, revitalization efforts of Pukapuka and its language is underway (Pasifika 2009).

Per the [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/trma2003130/ Te Reo Maori Act], Pukapukan is deemed to be a form of [[Cook Islands Māori]] for legal purposes.
