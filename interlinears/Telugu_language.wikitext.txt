Speakers of Telugu refer to it as simply ''Telugu'' or ''Telugoo''.{{sfn|Rao|Shulman|2002|loc=Chapter 2}} Older forms of the name include ''Teluṅgu'', ''Tenuṅgu'' and ''Teliṅga''.<ref>{{citation |first=Asko |last=Parpola |author-link=Asko Parpola |title=The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0190226923 |page=167}}</ref>

[[George Abraham Grierson]] and other linguists doubt this derivation, holding rather that ''Telugu'' was the older term and ''Trilinga'' must be the later Sanskritisation of it.<ref name=Grierson1967>{{Linguistic Survey of India|4|year=1967|orig-year=1906|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|place=Delhi|chapter=Telugu|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_tel_detail-1|access-date=12 June 2014 |p=576}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Sekaram |first=Kandavalli Balendu |title=The Andhras through the ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6E5AQAAIAAJ |year=1973 |publisher=Sri Saraswati Book Depot |page=4 |quote="The easier and more ancient "Telugu" appears to have been converted here into the impressive Sanskrit word Trilinga, and making use of its enormous prestige as the classical language, the theory was put forth that the word Trilinga is the mother and not the child." |access-date=26 January 2017 |archive-date=15 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215081753/https://books.google.com/books?id=E6E5AQAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> If so the derivation itself must have been quite ancient because ''Triglyphum'', ''Trilingum'' and ''Modogalingam'' are attested in ancient Greek sources, the last of which can be interpreted as a Telugu rendition of "''Trilinga''".<ref>{{citation |last=Caldwell |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Caldwell |title=A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages |publisher=Harrison |location=London |year=1856 |url=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil_elib/Cdw856__Caldwell_ComparativeGrammarDravidian.pdf |page=64 |access-date=26 January 2017 |archive-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011122303/http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil_elib/Cdw856__Caldwell_ComparativeGrammarDravidian.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Another view{{Whose|date=July 2019}} holds that ''tenugu'' is derived from the [[proto-Dravidian language|proto-Dravidian]] word ''ten'' ("south")<ref>{{Cite book|title=Telugu Basha Charitra|publisher=Osmania University|year=1979|location=Hyderabad|pages=6, 7}}</ref> to mean "the people who lived in the south/southern direction" (relative to Sanskrit and [[Prakrit]]-speaking peoples).

According to Telugu lore, its grammar has a prehistoric past. Sage [[Kanva]] was said to be the language's first grammarian. A. Rajeswara Sarma discussed the historicity and content of Kanva's grammar. He cited twenty grammatical aphorisms ascribed to Kanva, and concluded that Kanva wrote an ancient Telugu Grammar which was lost.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Nārada (Maha Thera)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhXRDSgBuL0C&q=telugu+country&pg=PA33|title=The Buddha-Dhamma, Or, the Life and Teachings of the Buddha|last2=Narasimhacharya|first2=Ramanujapuram|year=1999|isbn=9788120605596|access-date=3 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413225406/https://books.google.com/books?id=yhXRDSgBuL0C&q=telugu+country&pg=PA33|archive-date=13 April 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Post-Ikshvaku period ===
{{Main|Early Telugu epigraphy}}
The period from 4th century CE to 1022 CE corresponds to the second phase of Telugu history, after the [[Andhra Ikshvaku]] period.

Certain exploration and excavation missions conducted by the Archaeological Department in and around the Keesaragutta temple have brought to light, a number of brick temples, cells and other structures encompassed by brick [[prakaram]] along with coins, beads, stucco figures, garbhapatra, pottery, and Brahmi label inscriptions datable to 4th and 5th centuries CE. On top of one of the rock-cut caves, an early Telugu label inscription reading as 'Thulachuvanru' can be noticed. On the basis of [[palaeography]], the inscription is dated around the 4th to 5th centuries CE.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=Ancient Temples of Telangana_Book Pages 1 – 50 – Text Version &#124; AnyFlip|url=http://anyflip.com/voxm/rlzk/basic|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011122959/http://anyflip.com/voxm/rlzk/basic|archive-date=11 October 2017|access-date=28 July 2017|website=anyflip.com}}</ref>

This is evidenced by the first inscription that is entirely in Telugu, dated 575&nbsp;CE, which was found in the [[Rayalaseema]] region and is attributed to the [[Telugu Cholas|Renati Cholas]], who broke with the prevailing custom of using Sanskrit and began writing royal proclamations in the local language. During the next fifty years, Telugu inscriptions appeared in Anantapuram and other neighbouring regions.<ref>Period of Old [https://viralvidos.com/teluguwap-net-earn-money-online/ Telugu Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819015308/https://viralvidos.com/teluguwap-net-earn-money-online/ |date=19 August 2018 }} – 3 November 2015</ref> The Madras Museum plates of Balliya-Choda dated to the mid-ninth century CE are the earliest copper plate grants in the Telugu language.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy, Volume 10 of Epigraphy, Palaeography, Numismatics Series|first = D.

Tummalagudem inscription of Vishnukundinas belongs to 5th Century CE. (Epigraphia Andhrika, Vol.ii pages 9 to 14)

Telugu was more influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. Telugu literature was initially found in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of the rulers, and later in written works such as [[Nannayya]]'s [[Mahabharata|''Mahabharatam'']] (1022&nbsp;CE).<ref name="APOnline">{{cite web|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/Quick%20links/HIST-CULT/languages.html|title=APonline – History and Culture-Languages|work=aponline.gov.in|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208110254/http://www.aponline.gov.in/Quick%20links/HIST-CULT/languages.html|archive-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> During the time of Nannayya, the literary language diverged from the popular language. It was also a period of phonetic changes in the spoken language.

=== Middle Ages ===
The third phase is marked by further stylization and sophistication of the literary languages. During this period the split of the [[Telugu script|Telugu]] from [[Kannada alphabet]]s took place.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Dravidian Languages |last= Krishnamurti |first= Bhadriraju |year= 2003 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-77111-5 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dravidianlanguag00kris/page/n107 78]–79 |url=https://archive.org/details/dravidianlanguag00kris|url-access= limited }}</ref> [[Tikkana]] wrote his works in this script.

=== Vijayanagara Empire ===
The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its [[Golden Age]].<ref name="APOnline" />

[[File:Copper plates NMND-9.JPG|thumb|Telugu script on Copper plates, [[Eastern Chalukya]], 10th century CE.]]

=== Delhi Sultanate and Mughal influence ===
A distinct dialect developed in present-day [[Telangana]] region, due to Persian/Arabic influence: the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] was established earlier in the northern [[Deccan Plateau]] during the [[14th century]]. In the latter half of the 17th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the [[Hyderabad State]] by the dynasty of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] in 1724. This heralded an era of [[Persian literature|Persian]] influence on the Telugu language, especially [[Hyderabad State]]
. The effect is also evident in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the ''Kaifiyats''.<ref name="APOnline" />

In the princely [[Hyderabad State]], the [[Andhra Mahasabha]] was started in 1921 with the main intention of promoting Telugu language, literature, its books and historical research led by [[Madapati Hanumantha Rao]] (the founder of the Andhra Mahasabha), [[Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao]] (Founder of Library Movement in Hyderabad State), [[Suravaram Pratapareddy]] and others.

=== Colonial period ===
The 16th-century Venetian explorer [[Niccolò de' Conti]], who visited the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], found that the words in the Telugu language end with vowels, just like those in [[Italian language|Italian]], and hence referred to it as "The Italian of the East" ;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/when-foreigners-fell-in-love-with-telugu-language/article4227784.ece|title=When foreigners fell in love with Telugu language|first=M.

In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, the influence of the [[English language]] was seen, and modern communication/printing press arose as an effect of [[British Raj|British rule]], especially in the areas that were part of the [[Madras Presidency]]. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by such scholars as [[Gidugu Venkata Ramamoorty]], [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]], [[Gurazada Apparao]], Gidugu Sitapati and [[Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao]].<ref name="APOnline" />

Since the 1930s, what was considered an elite literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction of [[mass media]] like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools and colleges as a standard.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Geographical influence ==

=== Telugu region boundaries ===
Andhra is characterised as having its own mother tongue, and its territory has been equated with the extent of the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and the geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh-century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern [[Ganjam district]] in [[Odisha]] and to the south by [[Srikalahasteeswara temple]] in [[Chittoor district]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} However, [[Andhra]] extended westwards as far as [[Srisailam]] in [[Kurnool district]], about halfway across the modern state.<ref name = a>{{cite book |first=Cynthia |last=Talbot |title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C&pg=PA34 |date=20 September 2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803123-9 |pages=34– |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819172630/https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C&pg=PA34 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is [[Simhachalam]] and the southern limit is [[Tirumala]] of the Telugu Nation.<ref name = b>{{cite book|author1=Velcheru Narayana Rao|first2=David|last2=Shulman|title=Classical Telugu Poetry: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8UkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2002|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22598-5|pages=6–|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819204847/https://books.google.com/books?id=r8UkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name= c>{{cite book|title=International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics: IJDL.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XVkAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala.|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=20 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820023455/https://books.google.com/books?id=_XVkAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name= d>{{cite book|first=Ajay K.|last=Rao|title=Re-figuring the Ramayana as Theology: A History of Reception in Premodern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUyvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=3 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-07735-9|pages=37–|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819171152/https://books.google.com/books?id=OUyvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = e>{{cite book|first=S.|last=Krishnaswami Aiyangar|title=Evolution of Hindu Administrative Institutions in South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jRR9yu-u4kC&pg=PA6|year=1994|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0966-2|pages=6–|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=18 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818183833/https://books.google.com/books?id=6jRR9yu-u4kC&pg=PA6|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name= f>{{cite book|first=Cynthia|last=Talbot|title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSfoCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA195|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513661-6|pages=195–|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819115803/https://books.google.com/books?id=HSfoCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA195|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=g>{{cite book|first=Sambaiah|last=Gundimeda|title=Dalit Politics in Contemporary India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqXbCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT205|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-38104-4|pages=205–|access-date=17 May 2017|archive-date=20 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820014034/https://books.google.com/books?id=WqXbCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT205|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tamil Nadu]] has several dialects ranging from Madras dialect (which shares many common features within Rayalaseema Telugu), Coimbatore Telugu, and Madurai Telugu.

In Karnataka, [[Bangalore]] has its own distinct dialect somewhat related to the Rayalaseema Dialect.

The majority of Telugu speakers in Tamil Nadu and a large percentage in Karnataka are those who came during the time of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Although the dialects have been influenced by local languages, they have preserved many old and pure Telugu words that are not in common use in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana

In [[Sri Lanka]], an ethnic [[gypsies|gypsy]] minority known as the Ahikuntakas (otherwise called [[Kuravar]]s) in the [[Batticaloa district]] speak a localised dialect in the form of [[Sri Lankan Gypsy people|Sri Lanka Gypsy Telugu]].

== Phonology ==
The Roman transliteration of the Telugu script is in the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].

Telugu words generally end in vowels. In Old Telugu, this was absolute; in the modern language ''m, n, y, w'' may end a word. Atypically for a Dravidian language, voiced consonants were distinctive even in the oldest recorded form of the language. Sanskrit loans have introduced aspirated and murmured consonants as well.

Telugu does not have [[contrastive stress]], and speakers vary on where they perceive stress. Most place it on the penultimate or final syllable, depending on word and vowel length.<ref>Lisker and Krishnamurti (1991), "Lexical stress in a 'stressless' language: judgments by Telugu- and English-speaking linguists." ''Proceedings of the XII International Congress of Phonetic Sciences'' (Université de Provence), 2:90–93.</ref>

* The aspirated and breathy-voiced consonants occur mostly in Sanskrit and Prakrit loanwords, additionally /tʰ/ is used to substitute /θ/ in English loans, the only aspirate which occurs natively is /dʱ/ which occurs only in a few compound numbers e.g. /pɐddʱenimidi/ "18" likely a result of the proto Dravidian laryngeal */H/<ref name="bhk">{{Cite book |title= The Dravidian Languages |last= Krishnamurti |first= Bhadriraju |year= 2003 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-77111-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=54fV7Lwu3fMC |access-date= 8 December 2021 |archive-date= 11 August 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210811153829/https://books.google.com/books?id=54fV7Lwu3fMC |url-status= live }}</ref> though speakers often don't aspirate in these words. All of the fricatives except for native {{IPA|/s/}} also only occurs in loanwords.<ref name=":1"/>
* Perso-Arabic phonemes like /q, x, ɣ, z/ are substituted with /k, kʰ, ɡ, d͡ʒ/ similar to Hindi.<ref name=":1"/>
* /t͡s, d͡z/ occurs only in native words and doesn't have aspirated/breathy forms. Native words with /t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/ before non front vowels became /t͡s, d͡z/, the change became phonemized after loaning words with /t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/ from other languages. Intervocalically /d͡z/ can become [z] e.g. [rɐːzu, d͡zoːli, ɡudd͡zu].<ref name=":1"/>
* /ʋ/ can be rounded to a [β̞ʷ] around rounded vowels.<ref name=":1"/>
* The common Proto Dravidian approximant */ɻ/ merged with /ɖ/ in Telugu while it was preserved as /ɽ/ in the other Southern II branch languages.<ref name="bhk"/>

Most consonants contrast in length in word-medial position, meaning that there are long (geminated) and short phonetic renderings of the sounds. A few examples of words that contrast by length of word-medial consonants:<ref name=":1" />

* /ɡɐ'''d'''i/ ''gadi'' 'room' – /ɡɐ'''dː'''i/ ''gaddi'' 'throne'
* /ɐ'''ʈ'''u/ ''aṭu'' 'that side' – /ɐ'''ʈː'''u/ ''aṭṭu'' 'pancake'
* /mo'''ɡ'''ɐ/ ''moga'' 'male' – /moɡːɐ/ ''mogga'' 'bud' 
* /nɐ'''m'''ɐkɐmu/ ''namakamu'' 'a vedic hymn' – /nɐ'''mː'''ɐkɐmu/ ''nammakamu'' 'belief'
* /kɐ'''n'''u/ ''kanu'' 'to give birth to' – /kɐ'''nː'''u/ ''kannu'' 'eye' 
* /kɐ'''l'''ɐ/ ''kala'' 'dream' – /kɐ'''lː'''ɐ/ ''kalla'' 'falsehood' 
* /mɐɾi/ ''ma'''r'''i'' 'again' – /mɐ'''ɾː'''i/ ''marri'' 'banyan tree'

All [[retroflex consonant]]s occur in intervocalic position and when adjacent to a retroflex consonant, for instance. /ʋɐː'''ɳ'''iː/ ''vāṇī'' 'tippet', /kɐ'''ʈɳ'''ɐm/ ''kaṭṇam'' 'dowry', /pɐ'''ɳɖ'''u/ ''paṇḍu'' 'fruit'; /kɐ'''ɭ'''ɐ/ ''kaḷa'' 'art', /bɐː'''ɭʈ'''i/ ''bāḷṭi'' 'bucket' (from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''balde'' 'bucket'). With the exception of /ɳ/ and /ɭ/, all occur word-initial in a few words, such as /'''ʈ'''ɐkːu/ ''ṭakku'' 'pretence', /'''ʈ<sup>h</sup>'''iːʋi/ ''ṭhīvi'' 'grandeur', /'''ɖ'''ipːɐ/ ''ḍippā'' 'half of a spherical object', /'''ɖ<sup>ɦ</sup>'''oːkɐː/ ''ḍhōkā'' 'danger', and /'''ʂ'''oːku/ ''ṣōku'' 'fashionable appearance'.<ref name=":1" />

The approximant /j/ occurs in word-initial position only in borrowed words, such as /'''j'''ɐnɡu/ ''yangu'', from English 'young', /'''j'''ɐʃɐsːu/ ''yaśassu'' from Sanskrit ''yaśas'' /jɐɕɐs̪/ 'fame'.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Vowels ===
Vowels in Telugu contrast in length; there are short and long versions of all vowels except for /æ/, which only occurs as long. Long vowels can occur in any position within the word, but native Telugu words do not end in a long vowel. Short vowels occur in all positions of a word, with the exception of /o/, which does not occur word-finally.<ref name=":1" /> The vowels of Telugu are illustrated below, along with the Telugu script and romanization.

==== Allophones ====
In most dialects, the vowel {{IPA|/æː/}} only occurs in loan words. In the [[Guntur]] dialect, {{IPA|[æː]}} is a frequent allophone of {{IPA|/aː/}} in certain verbs in the past tense.

Telugu has two diphthongs: {{IPA|/ai/}} ఐ ''ai'' and {{IPA|/au/}} ఔ ''au''.

==== Vowel harmony ====
Telugu features a form of [[vowel harmony]] wherein the second vowel in disyllabic noun and adjective roots alters according to whether the first vowel is tense or lax.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wilkinson|1974|p=251}}</ref>{{fix|text=need illustrations}} Also, if the second vowel is open (i.e., {{IPA|/aː/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}), then the first vowel is more open and centralized (e.g., {{IPA|[m'''ɛː'''ka]}} 'goat', as opposed to {{IPA|[m'''eː'''ku]}} 'nail').{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Telugu words also have vowels in inflectional suffixes that are harmonized with the vowels of the preceding syllable.<ref>A Grammar of the Telugu Language, p. 295, [[Charles Philip Brown]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JOgUAAAAYAAJ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101233449/https://books.google.com/books?id=JOgUAAAAYAAJ |date=1 January 2016 }}</ref>

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Telugu grammar}}

The traditional study of Telugu Grammar is known as ''vyākaraṇam'' (వ్యాకరణం). The first treatise on Telugu grammar, the ''Āndhra Śabda Cinṭāmaṇi'', was written in Sanskrit by [[Nannayya]], considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 12th century CE. This grammar followed patterns described in grammatical treatises such as ''[[Aṣṭādhyāyī]]'' and [[Pāṇini|''Vālmīkivyākaranam'']], but unlike [[Pāṇini]], Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering ''samjnā'', ''[[sandhi]]'', ''ajanta'', ''[[halanta]]'' and ''[[kriya]]''. Every Telugu grammatical rule is derived from [[Pāṇini]]an concepts.

In the 19th century, Chinnaya Suri wrote a condensed work on Telugu grammar called ''Bāla Vyākaraṇam'', borrowing concepts and ideas from Nannayya's grammar.

=== Morphosyntax ===
Relations between participants in an event are coded in Telugu words through [[suffix]]ation; there are no prefixes or infixes in the language.<ref name=":0" /> There are six word classes in Telugu: nominals (proper nouns, pronouns), verbs (actions or events), modifiers (adjectives, quantifiers, numerals), adverbs (modify the way in which actions or events unfold), and clitics.

Telugu nouns are [[Morpheme|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular, plural), [[noun class]] (three classes traditionally termed ''masculine, feminine'', and ''neuter'') and [[Grammatical case|case]] ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], and [[Locative case|locative]]).<ref>{{Cite book| year=1857 |title= A grammar of the Telugu language |first = Charles Philip | last = Brown |edition=2 |publisher=Christian Knowledge Society's Press }}</ref>

==== Word order ==== 
The [[Word order|basic word order]] in Telugu is subject-object-verb

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Analysis
! Subject
! Object
! Verb
|-
|Read in Telugu
|Aame
|Market ku
|Potundi
|-
|Telugu translation
|ఆమె
|మార్కేట్ కు
|పోతుంది
|-
|English version
|She
|to market
|goes
|}

The example above can also be interpreted as 'Rama will go to school', depending on the context, but it does not affect the SOV order.

==== Noun classes (gender) ====
As with other Dravidian languages, gender in Telugu follows a semantic system,<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Gender|last=Corbett, Greville G.|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521329396|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=151–154|oclc=21227561}}</ref> in the sense that it is mostly the meaning of the word which defines the noun class to which it belongs. There are three noun classes: masculine (human males, ''he-''gender), feminine (human females, ''she''-gender), and neuter (all non-humans, ''it-gender''). The gender of most nouns is encoded through agreement/indexation in pronominal suffixes rather than overtly on the noun.<ref name=":0" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Masculine
!Feminine
|-
| {{interlinear|anna vacc-ā-'''ḍu'''|{older brother} come-PAST-'''MASC'''|'The older brother came'}}
| {{interlinear|amma vacc-in-'''di'''|mother come-PAST-'''FEM'''|'Mother came'}}
|}

In terms of the verbal agreement system, genders in marking on the Telugu verb only occurs in the third person.<ref name=":0" />
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!Third person
|'''Singular'''
|'''Plural'''
|-
!''Masculine''
|terucā'''-ḍu'''
''He opened''
|terucā-'''ru'''
''They opened''
|-
!''Feminine''
| teruc'''in-di'''
''She opened''
|terucā-'''ru'''
''They opened''
|-
!''Neuter''
|teruc'''in-di'''
''It opened''
|terucā-'''yi'''
''They (non-human) opened''
|}
The Telugu gender system is different from Dravidian languages like [[Tamil language|Tamil]] given that the Telugu feminine shares indexation morphemes with the masculine plural (''-ru'') and with the neuter singular (''-di''). What characterizes the three-gender system is then the individual behavior of the singular-plural ''pairs'' of suffixes.<ref name=":2" />

|-
!''Feminine''
|  -di/ -ru
|-
!''Neuter''
| -di/ -yi
|}

=== Pronouns ===
Telugu pronouns include personal pronouns (the persons speaking, the persons spoken to, or the persons or things spoken about); indefinite pronouns; relative pronouns (connecting parts of sentences); and reciprocal or reflexive pronouns (in which the object of a verb is acted on by the verb's subject).

In informal Telugu, personal pronouns distinguish masculine from non-masculine.<ref>{{Cite book |year=1873 |title=A progressive grammar of the Telugu language |first=Albert Henry |last=Arden |publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tW8IAAAAQAAJ&q=neuter+feminine&pg=PA57 |access-date=2014-08-03 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414013207/https://books.google.com/books?id=tW8IAAAAQAAJ&q=neuter+feminine&pg=PA57 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |year=1857 |title=A grammar of the Telugu language |first=Charles Philip |last=Brown |edition=2 |publisher=Christian Knowledge Society's Press |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnAIAAAAQAAJ&q=feminine&pg=PA39 |access-date=2014-08-03 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414012712/https://books.google.com/books?id=pnAIAAAAQAAJ&q=feminine&pg=PA39 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Demonstratives ====
There is a wide variety of [[Demonstrative|demonstrative pronouns]] in Telugu, whose forms depend on both proximity to the speaker and the level of formality. The formal demonstratives may also be used as formal personal pronoun, that is, the polite forms for ''this woman'' or ''this man'' and ''that woman'' or ''that man'' can also simply mean ''she'' and ''he'' in more formal contexts''.''

In the singular, there are four levels of formality when speaking about males and females, although the most formal/polite form is the same for both human genders. In both singular and plural, Telugu distinguishes two levels of distance from speaker (like in English), basically ''this and that'', and ''these and those''.

=== Case system ===
The nominative case (''karta''), the object of a verb (''karma''), and the verb are somewhat in a sequence in Telugu sentence construction. "''Vibhakti''" (case of a noun) and "''pratyāyamulu''" (an affix to roots and words forming derivatives and inflections) depict the ancient nature and progression of the language. The "''Vibhaktis''" of Telugu language " డు [ɖu], ము [mu], వు [vu], లు [lu]", etc., are different from those in Sanskrit and have been in use for a long time.

== Lexicon ==
<!--This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different sets of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc.-->
The lexicon of Telugu shows a pervasive influence of Sanskrit that goes back at least 1000 years; there is also evidence suggesting an earlier influence. It's estimated that 80% of Telugu's lexicon is derived from Sanskrit.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Kumar Suresh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99c-AQAAIAAJ|title=People of India: Delhi|last2=Ghosh|first2=Tapash Kumar|last3=Nath|first3=Surendra|date=1996|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|isbn=978-81-7304-096-2|page=36|language=en|access-date=25 May 2020|archive-date=11 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111043111/https://books.google.com/books?id=99c-AQAAIAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Bernadette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDpS6D60o8AC|title=Human-Machine Interaction in Translation: Proceedings of the 8th International NLPCS Workshop|last2=Carl|first2=M.|last3=Zock|first3=M.|last4=Jakobsen|first4=A.

Telugu absorbed ''[[tatsama]]s'' from Sanskrit.<ref>{{Cite journal |publisher=Telugu academy |first=G |last=Ramadasu |title=Telugu bhasha charitra |year=1980 }}</ref>

The vocabulary of Telugu, especially in [[Telangana]], has a trove of Persian–Arabic borrowings, which have been modified to fit Telugu phonology. This was due to centuries of [[Deccan sultanates|Turkic]] rule in these regions, such as the erstwhile kingdoms of [[Golkonda]] and Hyderabad (e.g., కబురు, {{IPA|/kaburu/}} for [[Urdu]] {{IPA|/xabar/}}, {{Nastaliq|خبر}} or జవాబు, {{IPA|/dʒavaːbu/}} for Urdu {{IPA|/dʒawɑːb/}}, {{Nastaliq|جواب}}).

Modern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a [[diglossia]] because the formal, standardised version of the language is either [[Lexicon|lexically]] Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, as taught in schools, and used by the government and Hindu religious institutions. However, everyday Telugu varies in such features depending upon region.

== Writing system ==
[[File:Telugu.svg|left|upright=0.68|thumb|The word ''Telugu'' written in the Telugu script]]
{{Main|Telugu script|Telugu Braille}}
[[File:Telugu consonants.svg|thumb|250px|right|Consonants – ''hallulu'' (హల్లులు)]]

The Telugu script is an [[abugida]] consisting of 60 symbols&nbsp;— 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. Telugu has a complete set of letters that follow a system to express sounds. The script is derived from the [[Brahmi script]] like those of many other Indian languages.<ref name="bot">[[:te:దస్త్రం:Telugulipi evolution.jpg]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2017}} The Telugu script is written from left to right and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters. The script is syllabic in nature—the basic units of writing are syllables. Since the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more basic units such as vowels ("''acchu''" or "''swaram''") and consonants ("''hallu''" or "''vyanjanam''"). Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes that are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere. Consonants are presumed pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them. However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied "a" vowel sound. When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel "''mātras''". The shapes of vowel "''mātras''" are also very different from the shapes of the corresponding vowels.

Historically, a sentence used to end with either a single bar। ("''pūrna virāmam''") or a double bar॥ ("''dīrgha virāmam''"); in handwriting, Telugu words were not separated by spaces. However, in modern times, English punctuation (commas, semicolon, etc.) has virtually replaced the old method of punctuation.<ref name="cpbrown">{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of the Telugu Language|last=Brown|first=Charles Philip|publisher=W. H. Allen & Co.|year=1857|isbn=978-81-206-0041-6|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/grammaroftelugul0000brow/page/5 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/grammaroftelugul0000brow/page/5}}</ref>

Telugu has full-zero (''[[anusvāra]]'') ( ం ), half-zero (''arthanusvāra'' or ''[[Chandrabindu|candrabindu]]'') (ఁ) and ''[[visarga]]'' ( ః ) to convey various shades of nasal sounds. [la] and [La], [ra] and [Ra] are differentiated.<ref name="cpbrown" />

Telugu has ''ĉ'' and ''ĵ'', which are not represented in Sanskrit. Their pronunciation is similar to the "s" sound in the word treasure (i.e., [[Voiced postalveolar fricative|the postalveolar voiced fricative]]) and "z" sound in zebra, ''i.e.'', [[Voiced alveolar fricative|the alveolar voiced fricative]], respectively.[[File:ఎన్నికల ప్రచార సామగ్రి దుకాణము.jpg|thumb|Wall painting at a shop in India.

== Literature ==

===The Pre-Nannayya Period (before 1020 CE)===

In the earliest period Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 CE onward.

===The Jain Literature Phase (850–1000 CE)===

Prabandha Ratnavali (1918) & Pre-Nannayya Chandassu (Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisekha Sanchika) by Veturi Prabhakara Sastry talk about the existence of Jain Telugu literature during 850–1000 CE. A verse from Telugu Jinendra Puranam by [[Pampa]], a couple of verses from Telugu Adi Puranam by Sarvadeva and [[Kavijanasrayam]] by [[Malliya Rechana]] were all authored by Jain poet's and are the examples for Jain contribution to Telugu Literature.

Historically, Vemulawada was a Jain knowledge hub and played a significant role in patronizing Jain literature and poets. Excavations in the 1980s around Vemulawada revealed and affirmed the existence of Telugu Jain literature.

[[Malliya Rechana]] is considered to be the first Telugu Author. P.V.Parabrahma Sastry, Nidadavolu Venkata Rao, and P.V.P Sastry have also pointed out that many Jain works could have been destroyed. Historical rivalry among Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism is well known.

===The Age of the Puranas (1020–1400 CE)===

This is the period of Kavi Trayam or Trinity of Poets. Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada (or Errana) are known as the Kavi Trayam.

[[Nannaya]] Bhattarakudu's (Telugu: నన్నయ) Andhra Mahabharatam, who lived around the 11th century, is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (aadi kaavyam).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet Aadi Kavi ("the first poet"). Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vālmīkivyākaranam but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya.[14] Nannaya completed the first two chapters and a part of the third chapter of the Mahabharata epic, which is rendered in the Champu style.

[[Tikkana Somayaji]] (1205–1288 CE): Nannaya's Andhra Mahabharatam was almost completed by Tikanna Somayaji (Telugu: తిక్కన సోమయాజి) (1205–1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.

[[Yerrapragada]]: (Telugu: ఎర్రాప్రగడ) who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter. He mimics Nannaya's style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana. These three writers – Nannaya, Tikanna and Yerrapragada – are known as the Kavitraya ("three great poets") of Telugu. Other such translations like Marana's Markandeya Puranam, Ketana's Dasakumara Charita, Yerrapragada's Harivamsam followed. Many scientific[relevant?] works, like Ganitasarasangrahamu by Pavuluri Mallana and Prakirnaganitamu by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.

=== Post-Trinity Poets ===
Baddena Bhupala (1220–1280 CE)" Sumati Shatakam, which is a neeti ("moral"), is one of the most famous Telugu Shatakams.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics{{according to whom|date=November 2021}} Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (Telugu: బద్దెన భూపాల) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} If we assume that the Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya.{{original research inline|date=April 2020}} The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.

[[Palkuriki Somanatha]]: Important among his Telugu language writings are the Basava Purana, Panditaradhya charitra, Malamadevipuranamu and Somanatha Stava–in dwipada metre ("couplets"); Anubhavasara, Chennamallu Sisamalu, Vrishadhipa Shataka and Cheturvedasara–in verses; Basavodharana in verses and ragale metre (rhymed couplets in blank verse); and the Basavaragada.

[[Gona Budda Reddy]]: His Ranganatha Ramayanam was a pioneering work in the Telugu language on the theme of the Ramayana epic. Most scholars believe he wrote it between 1300 and 1310 A.D., possibly with help from his family. The work has become part of cultural life in Andhra Pradesh and is used in puppet shows.

[[Paravastu Chinnayya Soori]] (1807–1861) is a well-known Telugu writer who dedicated his entire life to the progress and promotion of Telugu language and literature. Sri Chinnayasoori wrote the ''Bala Vyakaranam'' in a new style after doing extensive research on Telugu grammar. Other well-known writings by Chinnayasoori are ''Neethichandrika'', ''Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu'', ''Andhra Dhatumoola'', and ''Neeti Sangrahamu''.

[[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] (1848–1919) is generally considered the father of modern Telugu literature.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Landmarks in Telugu Literature |last= Sarma |first= Challa Radhakrishna |year= 1975 |publisher= Lakshminarayana Granthamala |page= 30 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rY4OAAAAYAAJ&q=Landmarks+in+Telugu+Literature |access-date= 1 March 2015 |archive-date= 13 April 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210413225336/https://books.google.com/books?id=rY4OAAAAYAAJ&q=Landmarks+in+Telugu+Literature |url-status= live }}</ref> His novel ''Rajasekhara Charitamu'' was inspired by the [[Vicar of Wakefield]]. His work marked the beginning of a dynamic of socially conscious Telugu literature and its transition to the modern period, which is also part of the wider literary renaissance that took place in Indian culture during this period.

Other prominent literary figures from this period are [[Gurajada Appa Rao]], [[Viswanatha Satyanarayana]], [[Gurram Jashuva]], [[Rayaprolu Subba Rao]], [[Devulapalli Krishnasastri]] and [[Srirangam Srinivasa Rao]], popularly known as ''Mahakavi'' Sri Sri. Sri Sri was instrumental in popularising free verse in spoken Telugu (''vaaduka bhasha''), as opposed to the pure form of written Telugu used by several poets in his time. Devulapalli Krishnasastri is often referred to as the [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] of Telugu literature because of his pioneering works in Telugu Romantic poetry.

[[Viswanatha Satyanarayana]] won India's national literary honour, the [[Jnanpith Award]] for his magnum opus ''Ramayana Kalpavrukshamu''.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature |last1= Datta |first1= Amaresh | last2 = Lal | first2 = Mohan  |year= 1991 |publisher= [[Sahitya Akademi]] |page= 3294 }}</ref> [[C. Narayana Reddy]] won the [[Jnanpith Award]] in 1988 for his poetic work, ''Viswambara''. [[Ravuri Bharadhwaja]] won the 3rd [[Jnanpith Award]] for Telugu literature in 2013 for ''Paakudu Raallu'', a graphic account of life behind the screen in [[film industry]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology |last= George |first= K.M. |year= 1992 |publisher= [[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn= 978-81-7201-324-0 |page= 1121 }}</ref> ''[[Bride price|Kanyasulkam]]'', the first social play in Telugu by [[Gurajada Appa Rao]], was followed by the progressive movement, the free verse movement and the Digambara style of Telugu verse. Other modern Telugu novelists include Unnava Lakshminarayana (''Maalapalli''), Bulusu Venkateswarulu (''Bharatiya Tatva Sastram''), [[Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao]] and Buchi Babu.
