'''Iñupiaq''' {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|uː|p|i|æ|k}}, '''Inupiaq''', '''Iñupiat''' {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|uː|p|i|æ|t}}, '''Inupiat''', '''Iñupiatun''' or '''Alaskan Inuit''' is an [[Inuit language]], or perhaps languages, spoken by the [[Iñupiat|Iñupiat people]] in northern and northwestern [[United States|American]] [[Alaska]], as well as a small adjacent part of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Northwest Territories]]. The Iñupiat language is a member of the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Inuit-Yupik-Unangax language family]], and is closely related to (but not mutually intelligible with) other Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uaf.edu/anlc/languages/stats/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428234536/http://uaf.edu/anlc/languages/stats/ |archive-date=2017-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is considered a threatened language with most speakers at or above the age of 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/esi|title=Inupiatun, North Alaskan|website=Ethnologue}}</ref> Iñupiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-alaska-languages-idUSKCN0ID00E20141024|title=Alaska's indigenous languages now official along with English|date=2016-10-24|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-02-19}}</ref>

The main varieties of the Iñupiaq language are [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] Iñupiaq and [[Seward Peninsula]] Iñupiaq.

The Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with [[English language|English]] in the late 19th century. American territorial acquisition and the legacy of [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding schools]] have created a situation today where a small minority of Iñupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities.

== History ==
The Iñupiaq language is an [[Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language]] and has been spoken in the northern regions of Alaska for as long as 5,000 years. Between 1,000 and 800 years ago, Inuit peoples migrated east from Alaska to Canada and [[Greenland]], eventually occupying the entire Arctic coast and much of the surrounding inland areas. The Iñupiaq dialects are the most conservative forms of the Inuit language, with less linguistic change than the other Inuit languages.

In the mid to late 19th century, Russian, British, and American colonists made contact with Iñupiat people. In 1885, the American territorial government appointed [[Sheldon Jackson|Rev. Sheldon Jackson]] as General Agent of Education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm|title=Sheldon Jackson in Historical Perspective|website=www.alaskool.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> Under his administration, Iñupiat people (and all Alaska Natives) were educated in English-only environments, forbidding the use of Iñupiaq and other indigenous languages of Alaska. After decades of English-only education, with strict punishment if heard speaking Iñupiaq, after the 1970s, most Iñupiat did not pass the Iñupiaq language on to their children, for fear of them being punished for speaking their language.

In 1972, the [[Alaska Legislature]] passed legislation mandating that if "a [school is attended] by at least 15 pupils whose primary language is other than English, [then the school] shall have at least one teacher who is fluent in the native language".<ref>Krauss, Michael E. 1974. Alaska Native language legislation. International Journal of American Linguistics 40(2).150-52.</ref>

Today, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] offers bachelor's degrees in Iñupiaq language and culture, while a preschool/kindergarten-level Iñupiaq immersion school named [[Nikaitchuat Ilisaġviat]] teaches grades PreK-1st grade in [[Kotzebue]].

In 2014, Iñupiaq became an official language of the State of Alaska, alongside English and nineteen other indigenous languages.<ref name=":0" />

In 2018, [[Facebook]] added Iñupiaq as a language option on their website. <ref>{{cite web |last1=D'oro |first1=Rachel |title=Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Facebook adds Alaska’s Inupiaq as language option |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/facebook-adds-alaskas-inupiaq-as-language-option |website=PBS NewsHour |publisher=NewsHour Productions LLC |access-date=3 December 2021}}</ref>

==Dialects==
There are four main dialect divisions and these can be organized within two larger dialect collections:<ref name="languagegeek">{{cite web |url=http://www.languagegeek.com/inu/inupiaq.html |title=Iñupiaq/Inupiaq |access-date=2007-09-28 |publisher=languagegeek.com}}</ref>
*Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq is spoken on the [[Seward Peninsula]]. It has a possible Yupik substrate and is divergent from other Inuit languages
**Qawiaraq
**Bering Strait
*Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq is spoken from the [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]] and [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]] regions of Alaska to the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] in Northwest Territories, Canada.  
**Malimiut
**North Slope Iñupiaq

Inter-intelligibility is difficult. Speakers from Noatak, for example (the Kotzebue dialect of Malimiut) have difficulty understanding speakers of the Kobuk dialect of Malimiut, and find King Island Iñupiaq to be completely unintelligible.<ref>Linda Lanz (2010) ''A Grammar of Iñupiaq Morphosyntax'', PhD dissertation, Rice University</ref>

'''<big>Extra geographical information:</big>'''

'''Bering Strait dialect:'''

The Native population of the Big Diomede Island was moved to the Siberian mainland after World War II. The following generation of the population spoke [[Central Siberian Yupik language|Central Siberian Yupik]] or Russian.<ref name="Dorais 2010" /> The entire population of [[King Island (Alaska)|King Island]] moved to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] in the early 1960s.<ref name="Dorais 2010" /> The Bering Strait dialect might also be spoken in [[Teller, Alaska|Teller]] on the [[Seward Peninsula]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

'''Qawiaraq dialect''':

A dialect of Qawiaraq is spoken in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Dorais 2010" /> A dialect of Qawariaq may also be spoken in [[Koyuk, Alaska|Koyuk]],<ref name="Dorais 2010" /> [[Mary's Igloo, Alaska|Mary's Igloo]], Council, and [[Elim, Alaska|Elim]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> The Teller sub-dialect may be spoken in [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Dorais 2010" />

'''Malimiutun dialect''':

Both sub-dialects can be found in [[Buckland, Alaska|Buckland]], [[Koyuk, Alaska|Koyuk]], [[Shaktoolik, Alaska|Shaktoolik]], and [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Dorais 2010" /> A dialect of Malimiutun may be spoken in [[Deering, Alaska|Deering]], [[Kiana, Alaska|Kiana]], [[Noorvik, Alaska|Noorvik]], [[Shungnak, Alaska|Shungnak]], and [[Ambler, Alaska|Ambler]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> The Malimiutun sub-dialects have also been classified as "Southern Malimiut" (found in [[Koyuk, Alaska|Koyuk]], [[Shaktoolik, Alaska|Shaktoolik]], and [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]]) and "Northern Malimiut" found in "other villages".<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

'''North Slope dialect:'''

Common North Slope is "a mix of the various speech forms formerly used in the area".<ref name="Dorais 2010" /> The Point Barrow dialect was "spoken only by a few elders" in 2010.<ref name="Dorais 2010" /> A dialect of North Slope is also spoken in [[Kivalina, Alaska|Kivalina]], [[Point Lay, Alaska|Point Lay]], [[Wainwright, Alaska|Wainwright]], [[Atqasuk, Alaska|Atqasuk]], [[Utqiaġvik]], [[Nuiqsut, Alaska|Nuiqsut]], and [[Barter Island]].<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

==Phonology==
Iñupiaq dialects differ widely between consonants used. However, consonant clusters of more than two consonants in a row do not occur. A word may not begin nor end with a consonant cluster.<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

All Iñupiaq dialects have three basic [[Vowel|vowel qualities]]: /a i u/.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Dorais 2010" /> There is currently no instrumental work to determine what [[allophone]]s may be linked to these vowels. All three vowels can be long or short, giving rise to a system of six phonemic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/. [[Vowel length|Long vowels]] are represented by double letters in the orthography: ⟨aa⟩, ⟨ii⟩, ⟨uu⟩.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> The following diphthongs occur: /ai ia au ua iu ui/.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name=":3" /> No more than two vowels occur in a sequence in Iñupiaq.<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

The Bering strait dialect has a fourth vowel /e/, which preserves the fourth proto-Eskimo vowel reconstructed as */ə/.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Dorais 2010" /> In the other dialects, proto-Eskimo */e/ has merged with the closed front vowel /i/. The merged /i/ is referred to as the “strong /i/”, which causes palatalization when preceding consonant clusters in the North Slope dialect (see section on palatalization below). The other /i/ is referred to as “the weak /i/”. Weak and strong /i/s are not differentiated in orthography,<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> making it impossible to tell which ⟨i⟩ represents palatalization “short of looking at other processes which depend on the distinction between two i's or else examining data from other Eskimo languages”.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Phonological Issues In North Alaska Iñupiaq|last=Kaplan|first=Lawrence|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center, University of Fairbanks|year=1981|isbn=0-933769-36-9|pages=85}}</ref> However, it can be assumed that, within a word, if a palatal consonant is preceded by an ⟨i⟩, it is strong. If an [[alveolar consonant]] is preceded by an ⟨i⟩, it is weak.<ref name=":4" />

Words begin with a [[Stop consonant|stop]] (with the exception of the [[palatal stop]] /c/), the [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] /s/, nasals /m n/, with a vowel, or the [[semivowel]] /j/. [[Loanword]]s, proper names, and exclamations may begin with any segment in both the Seward Peninsula dialects and the North Slope dialects.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> In the Uummarmiutun dialect words can also begin with /h/. For example, the word for "ear" in North Slope and Little Diomede Island dialects is ''siun'' whereas in Uummarmiutun it is ''hiun''.

A word may end in any nasal sound (except for the /ɴ/ found in North Slope), in the stops /t k q/ or in a vowel. In the North Slope dialect if a word ends with an m, and the next word begins with a stop, the m is pronounced /p/, as in ''aġna'''m t'''upiŋa,'' pronounced /aʁna'''p''' tupiŋa/<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

Very little information of the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of Iñupiaq has been collected. However, "fundamental frequency (Hz), intensity (dB), loudness (sones), and spectral tilt (phons - dB) may be important" in Malimiutun.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> Likewise, "duration is not likely to be important in Malimiut Iñupiaq stress/syllable prominence".<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

{{Notelist}}

The voiceless stops /p/ /t/ /k/ and /q/ are not aspirated.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> This may or may not be true for other dialects as well.

/c/ is derived from a palatalized and unreleased /t/.<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

==== Assimilation:<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> ====
Two consonants cannot appear together unless they share the manner of articulation (in this case treating the lateral and approximant consonants as fricatives). The only exception to this rule is having a voiced fricative consonant appear with a nasal consonant. Since all stops in North Slope are voiceless, a lot of needed assimilation arises from having to assimilate a voiceless stop to a voiced consonant.

This process is realized by assimilating the first consonant in the cluster to a consonant that: 1) has the same (or closest possible) area of articulation as the consonant being assimilated to; and 2) has the same manner of articulation as the second consonant that it is assimilating to. If the second consonant is a lateral or approximant, the first consonant will assimilate to a lateral or approximant if possible. If not the first consonant will assimilate to a fricative. Therefore:

|}
: <nowiki>*</nowiki> The sound /ɴ/ is not represented in the orthography. Therefore the spelling '''ġn''' can be pronounced as /ʁn/ or /ɴn/. In both examples 1 and 2, since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.

The stops /t̚ʲ/ and /t/ do not have a corresponding voiced fricative, therefore they will assimilate to the closest possible area of articulation. In this case, the /t̚ʲ/ will assimilate to the voiced approximant /j/. The /t/ will assimilate into a {{IPA|/ʐ/}}. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!IPA
!Example
|-
|/t̚ʲɣ/ → /jɣ/
|{{interlinear
 |siksrii'''t''' + '''g'''uuq → siksrii'''yg'''uuq

|-
|/tv/ → /ʐv/
|{{interlinear
 |aqpa'''t''' + '''v'''ik → aqpa'''rv'''ik
 |{"to run"} + "place" → {race track}|}}
|}

(In the first example above note that <sr> denotes a single consonant, as shown in the alphabet section below, so the constraint of at most two consonants in a cluster, as mentioned above, is not violated.)

In the case of the second consonant being a lateral, the lateral will again be treated as a fricative. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!IPA
!Example
|-
|/ml/ → /ml/<br>or → /vl/
|{{interlinear
 |aġna'''m''' + '''l'''u → {aġna'''ml'''u or aġna'''vl'''u}

|{{interlinear
 |aŋu'''n''' + '''l'''u → {aŋu'''nl'''u or aŋu'''ll'''u}
 |{"the man"} + "and" → {and the man}|}}
|}
Since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.

The sounds {{IPA|/f/}} {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} are not represented in the orthography (unless they occur alone between vowels). Therefore, like the /ɴn/ example shown above, assimilation still occurs while the spelling remains the same. Therefore:

These general features of assimilation are not shared with Uummarmiut, Malimiutun, or the Seward Peninsula dialects.

==== Palatalization<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> ====
The following patterns of palatalization can occur in North Slope Iñupiaq: /t/ → /t̚ʲ/,  {{IPA|/tʃ/}} or /s/;  {{IPA|/ɬ/}} → {{IPA|/ʎ̥/}}; {{IPA|/l/}} → {{IPA|/ʎ/}}; and /n/ → {{IPA|/ɲ/}}. Palatalization only occurs when one of these four alveolars is preceded by a strong ''i''. Compare:

If a t that precedes a vowel is palatalized, it will become an /s/. The strong ''i'' affects the entire consonant cluster, palatalizing all consonants that can be palatalized within the cluster. Therefore:

==== Phonological rules ====
The following are the phonological rules:<ref name=":3" />
The /f/ is always found as a geminate.

The /j/ cannot be geminated, and is always found between vowels or preceded by /v/. In rare cases it can be found at the beginning of a word.

The /h/ is never geminate, and can appear as the first letter of the word, between vowels, or preceded by /k/ /ɬ/ or /q/.

The {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} are always geminate or preceded by a /t/.

The {{IPA|/ʐ/}} can appear between vowels, preceded by consonants {{IPA|/ɣ/}} /k/ /q/ {{IPA|/ʁ/}} /t/ or /v/, or it can be followed by {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, /v/, {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.

Unlike the other Iñupiaq dialects, the Seward Peninsula dialect has a mid central vowel e (see the beginning of the phonology section for more information).

=== Gemination ===
In North Slope Iñupiaq, all consonants represented by orthography can be geminated, except for the sounds {{IPA|/tʃ/}} /s/ /h/ and {{IPA|/ʂ/}}.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq (using vocabulary from the Little Diomede Island as a representative sample) likewise can have all consonants represented by orthography appear as geminates, except for /b/ /h/ {{IPA|/ŋ/}} {{IPA|/ʂ/}} /w/ /z/ and {{IPA|/ʐ/}}. Gemination is caused by suffixes being added to a consonant, so that the consonant is found between two vowels.<ref name="MacLean 1986" />

==Writing systems==
{{see also|Iñupiaq Braille|Kaktovik Iñupiaq numerals}}
Iñupiaq was first written when explorers first arrived in Alaska and began recording words in the native languages.  They wrote by adapting the letters of their own language to writing the sounds they were recording.  Spelling was often inconsistent, since the writers invented it as they wrote.  Unfamiliar sounds were often confused with other sounds, so that, for example, 'q' was often not distinguished from 'k' and long consonants or vowels were not distinguished from short ones.

Along with the Alaskan and Siberian [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], the Iñupiat eventually adopted the [[Latin script]] (''Qaliujaaqpait'') that [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries developed in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]]. Native Alaskans also developed a system of [[pictograph]]s,{{Which|date=February 2012}} which, however, died with its creators.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html Project Naming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028155138/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html |date=2006-10-28 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

In 1946, Roy Ahmaogak, an Iñupiaq [[Presbyterian]] minister from [[Utqiaġvik, Alaska|Utqiaġvik]], worked with [[Eugene Nida]], a member of the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]], to develop the current Iñupiaq alphabet based on the Latin script.  Although some changes have been made since its origin—most notably the change from 'ḳ' to 'q'—the essential system was accurate and is still in use.

==Morphosyntax==
Due to the number of dialects and complexity of Iñupiaq Morphosyntax, the following section will be discussing Malimiutun morphosyntax as a representative example. Any examples from other dialects will be marked as such.

Iñupiaq is a [[Polysynthetic|polysynthetic language]], meaning that words can be extremely long, consisting of one of three stems (verb stem, noun stem, and [[Demonstrative (linguistics)|demonstrative]] stem) along with one or more of three endings ([[postbase]]s, (grammatical) [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], and [[enclitics]]).<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> The stem gives meaning to the word, whereas endings give information regarding case, mood, tense, person, plurality, etc. The stem can appear as simple (having no postbases) or complex (having one or more postbases). In Iñupiaq a "postbase serves somewhat the same functions that adverbs, adjectives, prefixes, and suffixes do in English" along with marking various types of tenses.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> There are six word classes in Malimiut Inñupiaq: nouns (see Nominal Morphology), verbs (see Verbal Morphology), adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, and interjections. All [[demonstrative]]s are classified as either adverbs or pronouns.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

=== Nominal morphology ===
The Iñupiaq category of [[Grammatical number|number]] distinguishes [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The language works on an [[Ergative–absolutive language|Ergative-Absolutive]] system, where nouns are inflected for number, several cases, and possession.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> Iñupiaq (Malimiutun) has nine cases, two core cases (ergative and absolutive) and seven oblique cases ([[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Allative case|allative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Perlative case|perlative]], [[wiktionary:similative case|similative]] and [[Vocative case|vocative]]).<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010">{{Cite thesis |last=Lanz |first=Linda A. |title=A grammar of Iñupiaq morphosyntax |date=2010 |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=Rice University |url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/62097/3421210.PDF |hdl=1911/62097}}</ref> North Slope Iñupiaq does not have the vocative case.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> Iñupiaq does not have a category of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Iñupiaq Nouns can likewise be classified by Wolf A. Seiler's seven noun classes.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite book<!--CB Not Jorunal--> |title= Iñupiatun Eskimo Dictionary |series=Sil Language and Culture Documentation and Descriptions |last=Seiler |first= Wolf A. |publisher= SIL International |year=2012 |pages= Appendix 7 |issn= 1939-0785 |url= http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022341/http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2014-05-28 }}</ref> These noun classes are "based on morphological behavior. [They] ... have no semantic basis but are useful for case formation ... stems of various classes interact with suffixes differently".<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

Due to the nature of the morphology, a single case can take on up to 12 endings (ignoring the fact that realization of these endings can change depending on noun class). For example, the possessed ergative ending for a class 1a noun can take on the endings: -ma, {{nbh}}mnuk, {{nbh}}pta, {{nbh}}vich, {{nbh}}ptik, -psi, -mi, -mik, -miŋ, -ŋan, -ŋaknik, and {{nbh}}ŋata. Therefore, only general features will be described below. For an extensive list on case endings, please see [https://web.archive.org/web/20160208062316/http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf Seiler 2012, Appendix 4, 6, and 7].<ref name=":5" />

==== Absolutive case/noun stems ====
The subject of an intransitive sentence or the object of a transitive sentence take on the [[absolutive case]]. This case is likewise used to mark the basic form of a noun. Therefore, all the singular, dual, and plural absolutive forms serve as stems for the other oblique cases.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> The following chart is verified of both Malimiutun and North Slope Iñupiaq. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Absolutive endings<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />
!
!Endings
|-
|singular
| -q, -k, -n, or any vowel
|-
|dual
| -k
|-
|plural
| -t
|}

If the singular absolutive form ends with -n, it has the underlying form of -ti /tə/. This form will show in the absolutive dual and plural forms. Therefore:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|tiŋmisuu'''n''' → tiŋmisuu'''ti'''k & tiŋmisuu'''ti'''t
|airplane {} {two airplanes} {} {multiple airplanes}
|}}

Regarding nouns that have an underlying /ə/ (weak i), the ''i'' will change to an ''a'' and the previous consonant will be geminated in the dual form. Therefore:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Ka'''mi'''k → ka'''mma'''k
|boot {} {two boots}
|}}

If the singular form of the noun ends with -k, the preceding vowel will be elongated. Therefore:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|sav'''ik''' → sav'''iik'''
|knife {} {two knives}
|}}

On occasion, the consonant preceding the final vowel is also geminated, though exact phonological reasoning is unclear.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

==== Ergative case ====
The [[ergative case]] is often referred to as the Relative Case in Iñupiaq sources.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /> This case marks the subject of a transitive sentence or a genitive (possessive) noun phrase. For non-possessed noun phrases, the noun is marked only if it is a third person singular. The unmarked nouns leave ambiguity as to who/what is the subject and object. This can be resolved only through context.<ref name="MacLean 1986" /><ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> Possessed noun phrases and noun phrases expressing genitive are marked in ergative for all persons.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

The sub-base of five shows in the words for 5, ''tallimat'', and 15, ''akimiaq'', to which the numbers 1 to 3 are added to create the words for 7, 8, 16, 17 and 18, etc. (''itchaksrat'' '6' being irregular). Apart from ''sisamat'' '4', numbers before a multiple of five are indicated with the subtractive element ''-utaiḷaq'': ''quliŋŋuġutaiḷaq'' '9' from ''qulit'' '10', ''akimiaġutaiḷaq'' '14' from ''akimiaq'' '15', ''iñuiññaġutaiḷaq'' '19' from ''iñuiññaq'' '20'.<ref name= "diction"/>

Scores are created with the element ''-ipiaq'', and numbers between the scores are composed by adding 1 through 19 to these. Multiples of 400 are created with ''-agliaq'' and 8000's with ''-pak''. Note that these words will vary between singular ''-q'' and plural ''-t'', depending on the speaker and whether they are being used for counting or for modifying a noun.

There is also a decimal system for the hundreds and thousands, with the numerals ''qavluun'' for 100, ''kavluutit'' for 1000, ''malġuk kavluutit'' for 2000, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.languagesandnumbers.com/how-to-count-in-inupiaq/en/esi/|title=Iñupiaq numbers}}</ref>

====Etymology====
The numeral five, ''tallimat'', is derived from the word for hand/arm. The word for 10, ''qulit'', is derived from the word for "top", meaning the ten digits on the top part of the body. The numeral for 15, ''akimiaq'', means something like "it goes across", and the numeral for 20, ''iñuiññaq'' means something like "entire person" or "complete person", indicating the 20 digits of all extremities.<ref name="diction">{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Bartley William |title= Iñupiatun Uqaluit Taniktun Sivuninit/Iñupiaq to English Dictionary|date=2014 |publisher=University of Alaska |location=Fairbanks |isbn=9781602232334 |pages=831–841 |edition=11}}</ref>

=== Verbal morphology ===
Again, Malimiutun Iñupiaq is used as a representative example in this section. The basic structure of the verb is [(verb) + (derivational suffix) + (inflectional suffix) + (enclitic)], although Lanz (2010) argues that this approach is insufficient since it "forces one to analyze ... optional ... suffixes".<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> Every verb has an obligatory inflection for [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (all marked by a single suffix), and can have other inflectional suffixes such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical modality|modality]], and various suffixes carrying adverbial functions.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

==== Tense ====
Tense marking is always optional. The only explicitly marked tense is the future tense. Past and present tense cannot be marked and are always implied. All verbs can be marked through adverbs to show relative time (using words such as "yesterday" or "tomorrow"). If neither of these markings is present, the verb can imply a past, present, or future tense.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

 |My sister (will) give(s) birth '''tomorrow'''. (the future tense "will" is implied by the word tomorrow)}}
|}

==== Aspect ====
Marking aspect is optional in Iñupiaq verbs. Both North Slope and Malimiut Iñupiaq have a [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] versus [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] distinction in aspect, along with other distinctions such as: [[frequentative]] (-ataq; "to repeatedly verb"), [[Habitual aspect|habitual]] (-suu; "to always, habitually verb"), [[Inchoative aspect|inchoative]] (-łhiñaaq; "about to verb"), and intentional (-saġuma; "intend to verb"). The aspect suffix can be found after the verb root and before or within the obligatory person-number-mood suffix.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

==== Mood ====
Iñupiaq has the following moods: [[Indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|Interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] (positive, negative), Coordinative, and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]].<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /><ref name=":5" /> Participles are sometimes classified as a mood.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

=== Syntax ===
<blockquote>Nearly all syntactic operations in the Malimiut dialect of Iñiupiaq—and Inuit languages and dialects in general—are carried out via morphological means."<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /></blockquote>The language aligns to an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]] case system, which is mainly shown through nominal case markings and verb agreement (see above).<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

The basic word order is subject-object-verb. However, word order is flexible and both subject and/or object can be omitted. There is a tendency for the subject of a transitive verb (marked by the ergative case) to precede the object of the clause (marked by the absolutive case). There is likewise a tendency for the subject of an intransitive verb (marked by the absolutive case) to precede the verb. The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a clause (both marked by the absolutive case) are usually found right before the verb. However, "this is [all] merely a tendency."<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" />

Iñupiaq grammar also includes morphological [[Passive voice|passive]], [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]], [[causative]] and [[applicative voice|applicative]].

==== Noun incorporation ====
[[Incorporation (linguistics)|Noun incorporation]] is a common phenomenon in Malimiutun Iñupiaq. The first type of noun incorporation is ''lexical compounding''. Within this subset of noun incorporation, the noun, which represents an instrument, location, or patient in relation to the verb, is attached to the front of the verb stem, creating a new intransitive verb. The second type is ''manipulation of case''. It is argued whether this form of noun incorporation is present as noun incorporation in Iñupiaq, or "semantically transitive noun incorporation"—since with this kind of noun incorporation the verb remains transitive. The noun phrase subjects are incorporated not syntactically into the verb but rather as objects marked by the instrumental case. The third type of incorporation, ''manipulation of discourse structure''<u>,</u> is supported by Mithun (1984) and argued against by Lanz (2010). See Lanz's paper for further discussion.<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> The final type of incorporation is ''classificatory noun incorporation'', whereby a "general [noun] is incorporated into the [verb], while a more specific [noun] narrows the scope".<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> With this type of incorporation, the external noun can take on external modifiers and, like the other incorporations, the verb becomes intransitive. See ''Nominal Morphology'' (''Instrumental Case, Usage of Instrumental'' table, row four) on this page for an example.

==== Switch-references ====
[[Switch-reference]]s occur in dependent clauses only with third person subjects. The verb must be marked as reflexive if the third person subject of the dependent clause matches the subject of the main clause (more specifically matrix clause).<ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /> Compare:

|The verb in the matrix clause (to eat) refers to the same person because the verb in the dependent clause (To get hungry) is reflexive. Therefore, a single person got hungry and ate.

 |Kaa'''ŋman''' niġiŋaruq.
 |hungry-3-'''{{gcl|NREFL|non-reflexive}}'''-COND eat-3-IND

|The verb in the matrix clause (to eat) refers to a different singular person because the verb in the dependent clause (To get hungry) is non-reflexive.

==Text sample==
This is a sample of the Iñupiaq language of the Kivalina variety from ''Kivalina Reader,'' published in 1975.

<blockquote>
Aaŋŋaayiña aniñiqsuq Qikiqtami. Aasii iñuguġuni. Tikiġaġmi Kivaliñiġmiḷu. Tuvaaqatiniguni Aivayuamik. Qulit atautchimik qitunġivḷutik. Itchaksrat iñuuvlutiŋ. Iḷaŋat Qitunġaisa taamna Qiñuġana.
</blockquote>

This is the English translation, from the same source:

<blockquote>
Aaŋŋaayiña was born in Shishmaref. He grew up in Point Hope and Kivalina. He marries Aivayuaq. They had eleven children. Six of them are alive. One of the children is Qiñuġana.
