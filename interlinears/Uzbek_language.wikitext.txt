'''Uzbek''' is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] that is the first official and only declared national language of [[Uzbekistan]]. The language of [[Uzbeks]] is spoken by some 34 million native speakers in [[Uzbekistan]], 3–4 million in [[Afghanistan]], and around 5 million in the rest of [[Central Asia]], making it the second-most widely spoken Turkic language after [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

Uzbek belongs to the Eastern Turkic or [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. External influences include [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel {{IPAslink|ɑ}} to {{IPAslink|ɔ}}, a feature that was influenced by Persian. Unlike other Turkic languages, [[vowel harmony]] is completely lost in Standard Uzbek, though it is (albeit somewhat less strictly) still observed in its dialects, as well as its sister Karluk language [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].

== Name ==
In the language itself, Uzbek is {{lang|uz|oʻzbek tili}} or {{lang|uz|oʻzbekcha}}. In [[Cyrillic alphabets#Uzbek|Cyrillic]], it is {{lang|uz-Cyrl|ўзбек тили}} or {{lang|uz-Cyrl|ўзбекча}}. In [[Arabic script]], {{lang|uz-Arab|اۉزبېک تیلی}} and {{lang|uz-Arab|اۉزبېکچه}}.

== History ==
Turkic speakers probably settled the [[Amu Darya]], [[Syr Darya]] and [[Zarafshan]] river basins from at least 600-650 CE, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of [[Eastern Iranian languages]] who previously inhabited [[Sogdia]], [[Bactria]] and [[Khwarezm]]. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in the 9th–12th centuries,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ooo-perevod.ru/news/uzbekskiy.html |title=The Origins of the Uzbek Language |access-date=5 January 2013 |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902021401/http://www.ooo-perevod.ru/news/uzbekskiy.html |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> who were a confederation of [[Karluks]], [[Chigils]], [[Yagma|Yaghma]] and other tribes.<ref name="sinor">{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter.

Uzbek can be considered the direct descendant or a later form of [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], the language of great [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] Central Asian literary development in the realm of [[Chagatai Khan]], [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), and the [[Timurid dynasty]]<ref name="allworth">{{cite book |title=Central Asia: 130 Years of Russian Dominance, a Historical Overview |last=Allworth |first=Edward |year=1994 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-1521-1 |pages=72 }}</ref> (including the early Mughal rulers of India).

By the 19th century it was rarely used for literary composition, but disappeared only in the early 20th century.

Uzbek ruler Shaybani Khan wrote poetry under the pseudonym "Shibani". A collection of poems by Shaybani Khan, written in the Central Asian Turkic literary language, is currently kept in the Topkapi manuscript collection in Istanbul. The manuscript of his philosophical and religious work: "Bahr ul-Khudo", written in the Central Asian Turkic literary language in 1508, is located in London.<ref>A.J.E.Bodrogligeti, «Muhammad Shaybanî’s Bahru’l-huda : An Early Sixteenth Century Didactic Qasida in Chagatay», Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher, vol.54 (1982), p. 1 and n.4</ref> Shaybani-khan's nephew [[Ubaydulla Khan]] skillfully recited the Koran and provided it with commentaries in the Turkic language.

The term ''Uzbek'' as applied to language has meant different things at different times. Prior to 1921 "Uzbek" and "[[Sart]]" were considered to be different dialects:
* "Uzbek" was a [[Vowel harmony|vowel-harmonised]] [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] variety spoken by descendants of those who arrived in [[Transoxiana]] in medieval period, who lived mainly around [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], although the Turkic spoken in [[Tashkent]] was also vowel-harmonised. It can be called old Uzbek and it's considered to be related to that specific group of people.
* "[[Sart]]" was a [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] dialect spoken by the older settled Turkic populations of the region in the [[Fergana Valley]] and the [[Qashqadaryo Region]], and in some parts of what is now the [[Samarqand Region]]; it contained a heavier admixture of Persian and Arabic, and did not have [[vowel harmony]]. It became the standard Uzbek language and the official dialect of Uzbekistan.

In [[Khanate of Khiva]], Sarts spoke a highly [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] Turkified form of [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] Turkic. However, the standard written language that was chosen for the new republic in 1924, despite the protests of Uzbek [[Bolsheviks]] such as [[Fayzulla Khodzhayev]], was not pre-revolutionary "Uzbek" but the "Sart" language of the Samarkand region. [[Edward A. Allworth]] argued that this "badly distorted the literary history of the region" and was used to give authors such as the 15th-century author [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]] an Uzbek identity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allworth|first=Edward A.|title=The Modern Uzbeks: From the Fourteenth Century to the Present: A Cultural History|year=1990|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8179-8732-9|pages=229–230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beCoAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT202 }}</ref> All three dialects continue to exist within modern spoken Uzbek.

{{Main|Uzbek alphabet}}

Uzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:
* 1000-1920s: The traditional Perso-Arabic script, first in the Karakhanid standard and next in the Chagatai standard. This is seen as the golden age of the Uzbek language and literary history. 
* 1920-1928: the Arabic-based [[Yaña imlâ alphabet]].<ref name=Batalden>{{cite book|last=Batalden|first=Stephen K.|title=The Newly Independent States of Eurasia: Handbook of Former Soviet Republics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFjPAxhBEaEC&pg=PA194|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89774-940-4|page=194}}</ref>
* 1928–1940: the Latin-based [[Yañalif]] was imposed officially.
* 1940–1992: the [[Cyrillic script]] was used officially.
* Since 1992: Switch back to Latin script, with heavy holdover usage of Cyrillic.
* 2019: reform of the Latin script (''planned'')
* 2021: reform of the Latin script (''planned'')

Despite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic.<ref name=Euro>{{cite book|author=European Society for Central Asian Studies.

In the western Chinese region of [[Xinjiang]] and in northern [[Afghanistan]], where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic-based script is still used.

== Phonology ==
Words are usually [[oxytone]]s (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed.

=== Vowels ===
Standard Uzbek has six vowel phonemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sjoberg|first1=Andrée F.|title=Uzbek Structural Grammar|series=Uralic and Altaic Series
|volume=18|date=1963|publisher=Indiana University|location=Bloomington|pages=16–18}}</ref> Contrary to many [[Turkic languages]], Uzbek no longer has [[vowel harmony]].

== Grammar ==
As a Turkic language, Uzbek is [[null-subject language|null subject]], [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and has no [[article (grammar)|articles]] and no [[noun class]]es (gender or otherwise). The word order is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV).

In Uzbek, there are two main categories of words: nominals (equivalent to nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some adverbs) and verbals (equivalent to verbs and some adverbs).

=== Nouns ===
Plurals are formed by suffix ''-lar''. Nouns take the ''-ni'' suffix as an definite article, unsuffixed nouns are understood as indefinite. The dative case ending ''-ga'' changes to ''-ka'' when the noun ends in ''-k'', or ''-qa'' when the noun ends in ''-q'' or ''-g‘'' (notice ''*tog‘qa'' → ''toqqa''). The possessive suffixes change the final consonants ''-k'' and ''-q'' to voiced ''-g'' and ''-g‘'', respectively (''yurak'' → ''yura'''g'''im'').<ref>{{citation|url=https://slaviccenters.duke.edu/sites/slaviccenters.duke.edu/files/file-attachments/uzbek.original.pdf|title=Uzbek Language|first=Zumrad|last=Ahmedjanova|website=slaviccenters.duke.edu}}</ref> Unlike neighbouring [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] languages, there is no irregularity on forming cases after possessive cases (''uyida'' "in his/her/its house", as opposed to Turkmen ''öýünde'').<ref name="CEOLOFTW"> {{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&pg=PA1146|first1=Lars|last1=Johanson|first2=Keith|last2=Brown|first3=Sarah|last3=Ogilvie|publisher=Elsevier|date=2009|isbn=978-0-08-087774-7|pages=1145–1148}}</ref>

The word order in the Uzbek language is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), like all other [[Turkic languages]]. Unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence.

== Number of speakers ==
Estimates of the number of speakers of Uzbek vary widely, from 25 up to 30 million. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' estimates put the number of native speakers at 27 million across all the recognized dialects. The Swedish national encyclopedia, ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', estimates the number of native speakers to be 30 million,<ref name="Nationalencyklopedin">"Världens 100 största språk 2007" ("The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007"), [[Nationalencyklopedin]]</ref>
and the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' estimates 25 million.

== Influences ==
The influence of [[Islam]], and by extension, [[Arabic]], is evident in Uzbek [[loanword]]s. There is also a residual influence of [[Russian language|Russian]], from the time when [[Uzbeks]] were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] through its historic roots. Uzbek has in turn also influenced [[Tajik language|Tajik]] (a variety of Persian).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ido |first=Shinji |date= March 21, 2014 |title= Bukharan Tajik|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/E909A0BEDE9E6F52A52FBB12A9255A6F/S002510031300011Xa.pdf/bukharan_tajik.pdf |journal= Journal of the International Phonetic Association |volume=44 |issue= 1 |pages=87–102 |doi=10.1017/S002510031300011X|s2cid=232344116 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGZedef70zAC&pg=PA655&dq=persian+language+uzbek&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj73pqGiOHfAhUIjSwKHY2dBwQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Hickey, Raymond 2010. The Handbook of Language Contact. Malden, MA: Wiley- Blackwel page 655]</ref> Of the Turkic languages, Uzbek is perhaps the one most strongly influenced by Persian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-ix|title=AZERBAIJAN ix. Iranian Elements in Azeri Turki – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}</ref>

== Dialects ==
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Nataev speaking Uzbek.webm|thumb|A man speaking Uzbek]]
Uzbek can be roughly divided into three dialect groups. The Karluk dialects, centered on Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and the Ferghana Valley, are the basis for the standard Uzbek language. This dialect group shows the most influence of Persian vocabulary, particularly in the important Turkic cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. The Kipchak dialect, spoken from the [[Surxondaryo Region|Surxondaryo region
]] through north-central Uzbekistan into [[Karakalpakstan]], show significant influence from the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] Turkic languages, particularly in the mutation of [j] to [ʑ] as in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]. The Oghuz dialect, spoken mainly in [[Xorazm Region|Khorezm]] along the Turkmenistan border, is notable for the mutation of word-initial [k] to [g].

== By country ==
=== Turkmenistan ===
In Turkmenistan since the 2000s the government conducted a forced "[[Turkmenization]]" of ethnic Uzbeks living in the country.<ref>[https://memohrc.org/ru/news/turkmenizaciya-rukovodyashchih-kadrov-v-dashoguze memohrc.org — "Туркменизация" руководящих кадров в Дашогузе]</ref><ref>[https://iamik.ru/news/zarubezhe/49082/ iamik.ru — Туркменизация узбеков]</ref><ref>[https://www.vb.kg/doc/351382_v_tyrkmenii_zavershaetsia_prinyditelnaia_tyrkmenizaciia.html vb.kg — В Туркмении завершается принудительная туркменизация]</ref> In the Soviet years and in the 1990s, the Uzbek language was used freely in Turkmenistan. There were several hundred schools in the Uzbek language, many newspapers were published in this language. Now there are only a few Uzbek schools in the country, as well as a few newspapers in Uzbek. Despite this, the Uzbek language is still considered to be one of the recognized languages of national minorities in this country. Approximately 300,000–600,000 Uzbeks live in Turkmenistan. Most of the Uzbek speakers live in [[Daşoguz Region|Dashoghuz Velayat]], as well as in [[Lebap Region|Lebap Velayat]] and partly in [[Ashgabat|Ashghabad]].<ref>[https://365info.kz/2018/04/turkmenskie-uzbeki-tiho-likuyut-i-sledyat-za-mirziyoevym 365info.kz — Туркменские узбеки тихо ликуют и следят за Мирзиёевым]</ref>

=== Russia ===
Uzbek is one of the many recognized languages of national minorities in [[Russia]]. More than 400 thousand [[Uzbeks]] are citizens of the Russian Federation and live in this country. Also in Russia there are 2 to 6 million Uzbeks from the [[Central Asia]]n republics (mainly [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]) who are immigrants and migrants. Large diasporas of Uzbeks live in such large cities of Russia as [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Kazan]], [[Volgograd]], [[Samara]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Perm, Russia|Perm]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Vladivostok]], [[Ufa]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Omsk]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Voronezh]], [[Saratov]] and [[Tyumen]]. Signs in Uzbek are often found in these cities. Signs refer mainly to various restaurants and eateries, barbershops, shops selling fruits, vegetables and textile products. There is a small clinic, where signs and labels in the Uzbek language. There are also illegal signs in Uzbek on the streets of these cities with underground sex services ("[[Call girl]]s"). Uzbeks in Russia prefer to use the Cyrillic Uzbek alphabet, but in recent years Uzbek youth in Russia are also actively using the Latin Uzbek alphabet. Small newspapers in Uzbek are published in large cities of Russia.<ref>[https://www.fergananews.com/articles/7393 fergananews.com — В Москве начинает выходить газета на узбекском языке]</ref><ref>[https://vesti.kg/politika/item/13247-v-moskve-nachinaet-vyihodit-gazeta-na-uzbekskom-yazyike.html vesti.kg — В Москве начинает выходить газета на узбекском языке]</ref><ref>[https://www.caravan.kz/news/v-moskve-nachinaet-vykhodit-gazeta-na-uzbekskom-yazyke-311291/ caravan.kz — В Москве начинает выходить газета на узбекском языке]</ref> Some instructions for immigrants and migrants are duplicated, including in Uzbek. Uzbek language is studied by Russian students in the faculties of [[Turkology]] throughout Russia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The largest Uzbek language learning centers in Russia are located in the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. There are also many [[Russians]] who are interested in and love the Uzbek language and culture and who study this language for themselves. Uzbek is one of the most studied languages among the many languages of the former USSR in Russia. Native speakers of Uzbek in Russia usually use in their vocabulary a lot of words from [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref>[https://www.the-village.ru/village/people/people/162387-lyudi-v-gorode-vypuskniki-shkoly-yazykov-migrantov the-village.ru — Москвичи, изучающие узбекский, таджикский и молдавский языки]</ref>
