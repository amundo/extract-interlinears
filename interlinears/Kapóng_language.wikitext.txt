'''Kapóng''' is a [[Cariban language]] spoken mainly in [[Guyana]], most commonly in the region of the Upper [[Mazaruni River|Mazaruni]]. Though many speakers do not live in villages, there are a number of population centers, notably [[Kamarang]], Jawalla, Waramadong, and Kako. There are two dialects, '''Akawaio''' and '''Patamona'''.

The Macushi name of the language is ''Ingarikó''.

== History ==
The Carib tribes practice an indigenous system of beliefs, one that dates back to the 16th century. It was not until the 19th century that attempts were made to understand the beliefs and practices of this tribe. Much of the Kapóng language refers back to sun worship and sun spirits, which is reflective of the beliefs system of these Carib-speaking tribes. Literature has also found belief in a higher being in the sky among the Carib tribes in Guyana.<ref name=":0" />

==Geographic Distribution==
The Kapóng language is found to be spoken in lowland tropical South America, particularly in the countries of Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela. 

In Guyana, Kapóng is spoken in forests by the Mazaruni River Basin. In 2013, a survey by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] identified 20% fluency among Akawaio, which was the highest fluency rate among all sampled  [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous groups in Guyana]]. However, no indigenous language was in use by the Guyanese Patamona people in the survey.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Bollers|first1=Elton|last2=Clarke|first2=Dillon|last3=Johnny|first3=Teniesha|last4=Wenner|first4=Mark|date=February 2019|title=Guyana's Indigenous Peoples 2013 Survey|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be93/5a07fcacc3ae173287c98d4679be7fe2d18d.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220005802/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be93/5a07fcacc3ae173287c98d4679be7fe2d18d.pdf|archive-date=2020-02-20|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-03|publisher=[[Inter-American Development Bank]]|page=67|doi=10.18235/0001591|s2cid=134838441}}</ref>

The number of speakers in Brazil is about 10,000, and the transmission of language in Brazil is deemed to be of good standing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Diversity Endangered|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|publisher=Walter de Gruyte|year=2015|isbn=978-3-11-090569-4|pages=38}}</ref> Speakers in Brazil are found in the Roraima Indigenous Terra Raposa. 

In Venezuela, Kapóng is spoken in the states of Bolivar and Monagas. 

==Dialects/Varieties==
Kapóng has three dialects, which are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America|last=Cambell|first=Lyle|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-3110170504|pages=203}}</ref>

==Vocabulary==
Much of the Kapóng language has emphasis on a higher spirit/god up in the sky, and this is reflected in the vocabulary in this language.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title="THE BURNING FOUNTAIN WHENCE IT CAME": (A study of the system of beliefs of the Carib-speaking Akawaio of British Guiana.)|last=Butt|first=Audrey J.|publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies|year=1953|location=University of the West Indies|pages=114–115}}</ref>

* ''Kapóng'' = Sky People
* ''akwalo'' = the spirit
* ''akwa'' = God's place
* ''Waica'' = warrior
* ''Taemogoli'' = grandfather
* ''Kapo'' = in the sky
* ''Iopotari akuru'' = chief spirit

== Morphology ==
''yamok'' (aemvk) is an ending used to make words plural. (i.e.) Adding ''yamok'' to "Kapong" makes "Kapong" plural; ''Kapong yamok''.<ref name=":0" />

-''da''  is a marker used to mark possession. (i.e.) ''kaata'' = book;    ''da kaata'' = <u>my</u> book.<ref name=":0" />

The word preferred word order of Kapóng is [[Subject–object–verb|subject-object-verb]], for example:<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Walter F.|date=September 1979|title=A Comparison of Selected Linguistic Features in Some Cariban and Arawakan Languages in Guyana|jstor=30027731|journal=Trustees of Indiana University Anthropological Linguistics|volume=21|issue=6|pages=277–297}}</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Walawokyamàkuya molok yachi
|boys-PL fish catch

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Kanau ikuurabök mang
|boat {he paddling} is
|"He is paddling the boat"}}

There are no gender distinctions found in Kap''ó''ng, as there are no differences in personal pronoun systems and affixes to indicate genders of nouns.

Similes are often used in writing, as many words in this language allow this to occur. Through the use of suffixes, many words can be converted into similes. Examples are as follows:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butt|first=Audrey J|date=1961|title=SYMBOLISM AND RITUAL AMONG THE AKAWAIO OF BRITISH GUIANA|journal=Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide|volume=41|pages=141–161|doi=10.1163/22134360-90002345|doi-access=free}}</ref>
