*Numbers from 1 to 10 are as follows: 1 ''langarnkiñe'', 2 ''langarnepu'', 3 ''langarnküla'', 4 ''langarnmeli'', 5 ''langarnkechu'', 6 ''langarnkayu'', 7 ''langarnregle'', 8 ''langarnpura'', 9 ''langarnaylla'', 10 ''langarnmari''; 20 ''langarnepu mari'', 30 ''langarnküla mari'', 110 ''langarn(kiñe) pataka mari''.  Numbers are extremely regular in formation, which is comparable to [[Chinese numerals#Reading and transcribing numbersChinese]] and [[Wolof languageWolof]], or to constructed languages such as [[Esperanto]].
*Verbs can be finite or non-finite (non-finite endings: ''-n'', ''-el'', ''-etew'', ''-lu'', ''-am'', etc.), are intransitive or transitive and are conjugated according to person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural), voice (active, agentless passive and reflexive-reciprocal, plus two applicatives) and mood (indicative, imperative and subjunctive). In the indicative, the present (zero) and future (''-(y)a'') tenses are distinguished. There are a number of aspects: the progressive, resultative and habitual are well established; some forms that seem to mark some subtype of perfect are also found. Other verb morphology includes an evidential marker (reportative-mirative), directionals (cislocative, translocative, andative and ambulative, plus an interruptive and continuous action marker) and modal markers (sudden action, faked action, immediate action, etc.). There is productive noun incorporation, and the case can be made for root compounding morphology.
*  "Spanish loan verbs have generally been adapted into Mapudungu in the third person singular form. An example is the Mapudungu verb for "to be able" is ''"pwede,"'' and the Spanish translation for "he can" is ''"puede."''
