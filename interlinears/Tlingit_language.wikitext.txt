[[File:WIKITONGUES- Lgeik'i and Naakil.aan speaking Lingít.webm|thumb|Two Tlingit speakers, recorded in the [[United States]].]]
The '''Tlingit language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ɪ|t|,_|-|ɡ|ɪ|t}} {{respell|KLING|kit|,_|-git}};<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> ''Lingít'' {{IPA-ath|ɬɪ̀nkɪ́tʰ|}})<ref>Maddieson et al. 2001</ref> is spoken by the [[Tlingit]] people of [[Southeast Alaska]] and [[Western Canada]] and is a branch of the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene language family]]. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast [[Alaska]] to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture.

Missionaries of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit by using the [[Cyrillic script]] to record and translate it when the [[Russian Empire]] had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to [[Sonoma County, California]]. After the [[Alaska Purchase]], English-speaking missionaries from the [[United States]] developed a written version of the language with the [[Latin alphabet]].

==History==
The history of Tlingit is poorly known, mostly because there is no written record until the first contact with Europeans around the 1790s.  Documentation was sparse and irregular until the early 20th century. The language appears to have spread northward from the [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]]–[[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] area towards the [[Chilkat Peninsula|Chilkat]] region since certain conservative features are reduced gradually from south to north. The shared features between the [[Eyak language]], found around the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] delta, and [[Tongass Tlingit]], near the [[Portland Canal]], are all the more striking for the distances that separate them, both geographic and linguistic.

==Classification==
Tlingit is currently classified as a distinct and separate branch of Na-Dene, an [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language family of North America]]. [[Edward Sapir]] (1915) argued for its inclusion in the Na-Dené family, a claim that was subsequently debated by [[Franz Boas]] (1917), [[Pliny Earle Goddard|P.E. Goddard]] (1920), and many other prominent linguists of the time.

Studies in the late 20th century by (Heinz-)Jürgen Pinnow (1962, 1968, 1970, int. al.) and [[Michael E. Krauss]] (1964, 1965, 1969, int. al.) showed a strong connection to [[Eyak language|Eyak]] and hence to the [[Athabaskan languages]].

Sapir initially proposed a connection between Tlingit and [[Haida language|Haida]], but the debate over Na-Dene gradually excluded Haida from the discussion. Haida is now considered an [[language isolate|isolate]], with some borrowing from its long proximity with Tlingit. In 2004, the Haida linguist John Enrico presented new arguments and reopened the debate. [[Victor Golla]] writes in his 2011 ''California Native Languages'', "John Enrico, the contemporary linguist with the deepest knowledge of Haida, continues to believe that a real, if distant, genetic relationship connects Haida to Na-Dene[.]"<ref name="Golla2011">{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Victor|author-link=Victor Golla|title=California Indian Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_yqdSE1F8wC&pg=PA303|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26667-4|page=303}}</ref>

==Geographic distribution==
The Tlingit language is distributed from near the mouth of the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] down the open coast of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and throughout almost all of the islands of the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in [[Southeast Alaska]]. It is characterized by four or five distinct dialects, but they are mostly mutually intelligible. Almost all of the area where the Tlingit language is endemic is contained within the modern borders of [[Alaska]].

The exception is an area known as "Inland Tlingit" that extends up the [[Taku River]] and into northern [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon]] around [[Atlin Lake]] (''Áa Tleen'' "Big Lake") and [[Teslin Lake]] (''Desleen'' < ''Tas Tleen'' "Big Thread") lake districts, as well as a concentration around [[Bennett Lake]] at the end of the [[Chilkoot Trail]] (''Jilkhoot''). Otherwise, Tlingit is not found in [[Canada]]. Tlingit legend tells that groups of Tlingit once inhabited the [[Stikine River|Stikine]], [[Nass River|Nass]], and [[Skeena River|Skeena]] river valleys during their migrations from the interior. There is a small group of speakers (some 85) in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as well.<ref>[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&mode=lang_tops&lang_id=866 "Tlingit territory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817053334/http://www.mla.org/map_data_states%26mode%3Dlang_tops%26lang_id%3D866 |date=2007-08-17 }}, Modern Language Association</ref>

=== Use and revitalization efforts ===
Golla (2007) reported a decreasing population of 500 speakers in Alaska. The [[First Peoples' Cultural Council]] (2014) reported 2 speakers in Canada out of an ethnic population of 400.<!--sourced from ethnologue-->

As of 2013, Tlingit courses are available at the [[University of Alaska Southeast]].<ref name = "ktoo201310">{{Cite episode

==Dialects==
Tlingit is divided into roughly five major dialects, all of which are essentially mutually intelligible:
* The Northern dialect is also called the Yakutat (''Yakhwdaat'') dialect, after its principal town and is spoken in an area south from [[Lituya Bay]] (''Litu.aa'') to [[Frederick Sound]].
* The Transitional dialect, a two-tone dialect like the Northern dialect but has phonological features of the Southern, is historically spoken in the villages of [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]] (''Gántiyaakw Séedi'' "Steamboat Canyon"), [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]] (''Khéixh' '' "Daylight"), and [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]] (''Khaachxhana.áak'w'' "Khaachxhan's Little Lake"), and in the surrounding regions although it has almost disappeared.
* The similarly-moribund Southern dialects of ''Sanya'' and ''Heinya'' are spoken from [[Sumner Strait]] south to the Alaska-Canada border, excepting [[Annette Island]], which is the reservation of the [[Tsimshian]], and the southern end of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]], which is the land of the Kaigani [[Haida people|Haida]] (''K'aayk'aani'').
* The [[Inland Tlingit]] dialect is spoken in Canada around [[Atlin Lake]] and [[Teslin Lake]].
* The Tongass Tlingit dialect was once spoken in the Cape Fox area south of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] but recently died with its last speakers in the 1990s.

The various dialects of Tlingit can be classified roughly into two-tone and three-tone systems. Tongass Tlingit, however, has no tone but a four-way [[register (phonology)|register]] contrast between short, long, glottalized, and "fading" vowels. (In the last type, the onset of the vowel is articulated normally but the release is [[murmured voice|murmured]], essentially a rapid opening of the glottis once articulation is begun.)

The tone values in two-tone dialects can be predicted in some cases from the three-tone values but not the reverse. Earlier, it was hypothesized that the three-tone dialects were older and that the two-tone dialects evolved from them. However, [[Jeff Leer]]'s discovery of the Tongass dialect in the late 1970s has shown{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} that the Tongass vowel system is adequate to predict the tonal features of both the two-tone and three-tone dialects, but none of the tonal dialects could be used to predict vocalic feature distribution in Tongass Tlingit. Thus, Tongass Tlingit is the most conservative of the various dialects of Tlingit, preserving contrasts which have been lost in the other dialects.

The fading and glottalized vowels in Tongass Tlingit have also been compared with similar systems in the [[Coast Tsimshian dialect]]. However, Krauss and Leer (1981, p.&nbsp;165) point out that the fading vowels in Coastal Tsimshian are the surface realization of [[underlying representation|underlying]] sequences of vowel and glottalized sonorant, {{IPA|VʔC}}. That is in contradistinction to the glottal modifications in Tongass Tlingit, which Leer argues are symmetric with the modifications of the consonantal system. Thus, a fading vowel {{IPA|V̤}} is symmetric{{clarify|date=September 2015}} with an aspirated consonant {{IPA|Cʰ}}, and a glottalized vowel {{IPA|Vʔ}} is symmetric with an ejective (glottalized) consonant {{IPA|Cʼ}}. That implies that the two systems have no familial relationship. Leer (1978) speculated that the maintenance of the pretonal system in Tongass Tlingit was caused by the proximity of its speakers around the Cape Fox area near the mouth of the [[Portland Canal]] to speakers of Coastal Tsimshian, just to the south.

==Phonology==

Tlingit has a complex [[phonology|phonological]] system compared to [[Indo-European languages]] such as English or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It has an almost complete series of [[ejective]] consonants accompanying its stop, fricative, and affricate consonants. The only missing consonant in the Tlingit ejective series is {{IPA|[ʃʼ]}}. The language is also notable for having several [[lateral consonant|laterals]] but no voiced {{IPA|[l]}} and for having no [[labial consonant|labials]] in most dialects, except for {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[p]}} in recent English [[loanword]]s.

It occurs as  ''g'' occasionally in placenames derived from Tlingit during the 18th and the 19th centuries as well as in some broad transcriptions by earlier anthropologists: "Gan Gulihashee Hit" for ''Ÿan Ÿuliháshi Hít'' "Drifted Ashore House" as recorded by Olson, today written ''Yan Wuliháshi Hít''. Because the use of ''y'' versus ''w'' is predictable from context where it was originally a ''ÿ'', this graph is used consistently in linguistic transcription, but not in ordinary writing.

{{Notelist}}

[[Nasal stop|Nasal consonants]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilating]] with {{IPA|/n/}} and the [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] is common among Tlingit-speakers of all dialects. For example, the sequence ''ng'' ({{IPA|/nk/}}) is often heard as {{IPA|[ŋk]}} and ''ngh'' ({{IPA|/nq/}}) as {{IPA|[ɴq]}}. Native speakers in a teaching position may admonish learners when they produce these assimilated forms, deriding them as "not Tlingit" or "too English", but it is common to later hear such speakers producing those forms themselves. It is uncertain whether this assimilation is autochthonous or if it arose from contact with English, but the former is more likely from a purely-articulatory perspective.

Young speakers and second-language learners are increasingly making a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced/unvoiced]] distinction between consonants, rather than the traditional [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated/aspirated]] distinction. That is because of the influence of English, which makes a similar distinction. For speakers who make the voiced/unvoiced distinction, the distribution is symmetrical with the unaspirated/aspirated distinction among other speakers.

[[Ian Maddieson|Maddieson]], Smith, and Bessel (2001) note that all word final non-ejective stops are phonemically unaspirated. That contrasts with the orthography that typically represents them as aspirated stops: ''t'' {{IPA|[tʰ]}} for the more accurate ''d'' {{IPA|[t]}}. There is a wide variation in ordinary speech, ranging from unreleased {{IPA|[t̚]}} to a very delayed aspiration {{IPA|[tːʰ]}}. However, the underlying phoneme is certainly unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}} since it is consistently produced when the word is suffixed. The orthography usually but not always reflects that: ''hít'' "house" is written ''(du) hídi'' "(his) house" when marked with the possessive suffix ''-ÿí''. It is possible but has not been verified that aspirated and unaspirated stops are collapsed into a single phoneme word-finally.

Maddieson and colleagues also confirm that the [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] in Tlingit are in fact true ejectives, despite the widely-held assumption that ejective fricatives are not actually phonetically ejective but are as a sequence of fricative and glottal stop. In Tlingit, at least, the articulation of ejective fricatives includes complete closure of the glottis before frication begins, and the larynx is raised in the same manner as with ejective stops.

Characteristically, the ejective fricatives in Tlingit feature a much smaller aperture for frication than is found in ordinary fricatives. That articulation provides increased resistance to counter the continual loss of dynamic airstream pressure. Also, ejective fricatives appear to include tightening of the pharyngeal muscles, which reduces the diameter of the air column and so further increases pressure. That pharyngeal constriction is not true pharyngealization, however, since the diameter is still greater than what is found in pharyngealized consonants in other languages.

===Vowels===

Tlingit has eight [[vowel]]s, four vowels further distinguished formally by [[vowel length|length]]. However, the length distinction is often in terms of [[tenseness]] rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an [[acute accent]] (''áa'') and low tone is unmarked (''aa''). The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a [[grave accent]] (''àa'').

| 
|}

As noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of {{IPA|/aː/}} (orthographic ''aa'') which is realized as {{IPA|[ɒː]}} under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants and so the word ''kháa'' "person" is often spoken as {{IPA|[qʰɒ́ː]}}, but the word ''(a) káa'' "on (its) surface" is said as {{IPA|[(ʔʌ) kʰáː]}} by the same speakers.

Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit and so words never begin with a vowel. Where a vowel would theoretically have occurred, such as by prefixing or compounding, the vowel is always followed by either {{IPA|[ʔ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}. The former is universal in single words, and both are found in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in word-initial position, but either ''.'' or ''y'' may be seen in medial position. For example:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|top={{IPA|[qʰuːwʌtʼáː]}}{{br}}khoowat'áa
|khu- ÿu- ÿa- t'áa
|{{gcl|INDH|indefinite human}}.OBJ- PERF- {(0, -D, +I)}- hot
|"the weather is hot"}}

But when the perfective prefix ''ÿu-'' is word-initial, the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant.

{{interlinear|indent=3
|top={{IPA|[ʔʊwʌtʼáː]}}{{br}}uwat'áa
|0- ÿu- ÿa- t'áa
|3.{{gcl|NEU|neutral}}.OBJ- PERF- {(0, -D, +I)}- hot
|"it is hot"}}

==Writing system==
{{Main|Tlingit alphabet}}
Until the late 1960s, Tlingit was written exclusively in phonetic transcription in the works of linguists and anthropologists except for a little-known Cyrillic alphabet used for publications by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. A number of amateur anthropologists doing extensive work on the Tlingit had no training in linguistics and so left numerous samples in vague and inconsistent transcriptions, the most famous being [[George T. Emmons]]. However, such noted anthropologists as [[Franz Boas]], [[John R. Swanton]], and [[Frederica de Laguna]] have transcribed Tlingit in various related systems that feature accuracy and consistency but sacrifice readability.

Two problems ensue from the multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that there are many of them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The other is that most transcriptions made before Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Accuracy of transcription can be increased by checking against similar words in other systems, or against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.

==Grammar==

Tlingit grammar at first glance appears to be highly [[Fusional language|fusional]], but this is an incorrect assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Despite not being a fusional language, Tlingit is still highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]] as an [[agglutinating language]], and is even [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporating]]. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.

===Word order===

Tlingit [[word order]] is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] when non-[[pronominal]] [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]] [[phrase]]s both exist in the sentence. However, there is a strong urge to restrict the argument of the [[verb phrase]] to a single non-pronominal [[noun phrase]], with any other phrases being extraposed from the verb phrase. If a noun phrase occurs outside of the verb phrase then it is typically represented in the verb phrase by an appropriate pronoun.

===Nouns===
:''See main article: [[Tlingit noun]]''

===Pronominals===

Tlingit has a complex system of [[Pronoun|pronominals]], which vary depending on their relationship to the verb. The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot. The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb "complex"), but most are graphically independent. They are divided into three classes, the verbal object, nominal object, and postpositional object. There are also the independent pronominals which are completely separate from the verb and can be used in dependent clauses or in subject or object position.

The pronominals all have related semantic values, and their organization can hence easily be visualized in a table.

The numbers in the first column represent the usual concept of person, i.e. first, second, or third. Story and Naish identified a [[fourth person]], but this term is inappropriate since they did not describe a clear separation between the so-called fourth person and the other impersonal pronominals.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

When analyzing a sentence, the pronominal type is given first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1<small>SINGULAR SUBJECT</small> is the first person singular subject pronominal, realized as ''xhat''. The <small>RECIPROCAL</small> does not uniquely identify one of the two reciprocal pronominals, but since they are both phonetically identical as ''woosh'', it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them.

There is also a notional zeroth person which can be of subject, object, or independent form. This is not realized in Tlingit, instead it is an empty placeholder for analysis.

====Subject pronominals====

The subject pronominals are all incorporated into the verb. Thus when the subject is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the sentence is empty.

====Object pronominals====

Object pronominals are divided into three classes, the verbal, nominal, and postpositional.

The verbal object pronominals function similarly to the subject pronominals in that they preclude an explicit object when used.

The nominal object pronominals are similar in some respects to the possessive pronouns of English. They precede a noun and represent the object of the noun, typically implying possession of the noun.

Postpositional object pronominals function as objects to which postpositions are attached. They act as the object of a postposition in a manner similar to an ordinary noun suffixed with a postposition.

===Directionals===

Strictly speaking, the Tlingit directionals can be classified as nouns on the basis of their syntactic function. However, they form a distinct semantic set of nouns which indicate direction relative to some stated position. They also show stem variation depending locative suffixation, in particular with the allative suffix ''-dei''. These stem variants also occur with the adverb construction ''N<sub>1</sub>''-da-''N<sub>2</sub>''-(i)n "''N<sub>2</sub>'' ''N<sub>1</sub>''-ward" where ''N<sub>2</sub>'' is an anatomic noun and ''N<sub>1</sub>'' is a directional stem.

===Particles===

Particles function as neither noun nor verb. They are restricted to positions relative to phrases in the sentence.

====Focus particles====

The focus particles follow the left periphery ("forephrase" per Leer) of a sentence. The Naish-Story term for them is "post-marginals". Many of them may be suffixed with a demonstrative (''-yá'', ''-hé'', ''-wé'', ''-yú''), and they may also be combined with the interrogative (''-gé''). Focus particles are stylistically written as separate words, but phonetically, they may be indivisible from the preceding utterance.

* ''sá'' — wh-question
* ''gé'' — dubitative, unlikelihood, "perhaps", "maybe, "it would seem..."
* ''á'' — focus
* ''ágé'' — interrogative (< ''á'' + ''gé'')
* ''ásé'' — discovery, understanding of previously unclear information, "oh, so..."
* ''ásgé'' — second hand information, "I hear...", "they say..." (< ''ásé'' + ''gé'')
* ''khu.aa'' — contrastive, "however"
* ''xháa'' – softening, "you see"
* ''shágdéi'' — dubitative, likelihood, "perhaps", "probably"
* ''dágáa'' — emphatic assertion, "indeed", "for sure"
* ''shéi'' — mild surprise
* ''gwáa'', ''gu.áa'' — strong surprise
* ''gwshéi'', ''gushéi'' — rhetorical interrogative, request for corroboration, "I wonder", "perhaps"
* ''óosh'' — hypothetical, "as if", "even if", "if only"

The combination of the focus ''á'' with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles ''áyá'' and ''áwé'', and the less common ''áhé'' and ''áyú''. Combination of the interrogative ''ágé'' with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles ''ákwé'' and ''ákyá'' (''ák-hé'' and ''ákyú'' are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.

The interrogative ''ágé'' also usually contracts to ''ág'' before ''tsú'' "also": ''ág tsú'' "also?" < ''ágé'' + ''tsú''.

The particle ''sá'' is obligatory in forming [[Interrogative word|wh-question]] phrases. It can be combined with a demonstrative, the dubitative, the rhetorical interrogative, and the emphatic assertion:

* ''sáwé'' (< ''sá'' + ''áwé''), ''sáyá'', ... — focused question, "... is that?"
* ''sgé'' (< ''sá'' + ''gé'') — dubitative question, "maybe?", "perhaps?"
* ''ságwshéi'' — "I wonder?"
* ''sdágáa'' (< ''sá'' + ''dágáa'') — "(what) on earth?", "really?"

====Phrasal particles====

Phrasal particles may occur after focus particles that occur with or without demonstrative finals. The following are postphrasal particles, thus they may only occur after the phrase that they modify.

* ''tsá'' — "only then"
* ''tsú'' — "also"
* ''s'é'' — "first", "really!"
* ''déi'' — "now", "this time"
* ''x'wán'' — "be sure to"
* ''tsé'' — "be sure not to"

Except for ''x'wán'' and ''tsé'', the above may occur after the focus particles.

The following are prephrasal particles, i.e. they occur before the phrase that they modify. Naish and Story call these "pre-marginals".

* ''ch'a'' — "just", "the very"
* ''ch'as'' — "only", "just"
* ''ch'ú'' — "even"
* ''tlaxh'' — "very"

====Mobile particles====

These particles may occur before or after any phrase in a clause.

* ''tlei'' — "just," "simply," "just then"
* ''déi'' — "already," "by now"
* ''tsu'' — "again", "still", "some more"

Compare the mobile particle ''tsu'' with the postphrasal particle ''tsú''. Both the sentence ''káaxwei '''tsu''' eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' "I need more coffee" and the sentence ''káaxwei '''tsú''' eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' "I also need coffee" are acceptable. However the sentence ''*'''tsú''' káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' is syntactically inadmissible because the particle ''tsú'' is postphrasal, i.e. it cannot precede the phrase it modifies, in this case the noun phrase ''káaxwei''. The corresponding sentence with the ''tsu'' particle in front, '''''tsu''' káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee''  "I need coffee again/still" is in contrast syntactically acceptable. Thus a Tlingit listener will recognize the ''tsu'' particle in a phrase-initial position without confusion but tone is necessary to distinguish it in a phrase-final position. For this reason the ''tsu'' particle is often used prephrasally although it is syntactically admitted in either position. Thus the song name ''Tsu Héidei Shugaxhtootaan'' could also be ''héidei tsu shugaxhtootaan'', but placing the ''tsu'' in front has the advantage of unambiguity, and thus seems more [[Euphony|euphonious]] to native speakers.

Note that ''déi'' is a homonym with the noun ''déi'' "path, way, road". [How are these differentiated in speech?]

The particle ''tlei'' is easily confused with ''tléil'' "no, not", but as with the ''tsu/tsú'' pair the tone makes them unambiguous.

====Sentence-initial particles====

These particles may only occur at the front of a sentence. Naish-Story term these "clause marginals".

* ''tléik'', ''l'' — negative, "not"
* ''gwál'' — dubitative, "perhaps"
* ''gu.aal'' — optative, "hopefully"
* ''khaju'', ''xhaju'' — contrary, "actually", "in fact"
* ''khashde'' — "I thought..."
