'''Mandan''' (Mandan: ''Nų́ų́ʔetaa íroo'') is an extinct [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] language of [[North Dakota]] in the United States.

== Use and revitalization efforts ==
By 2009, there was just one fluent speaker of Mandan, Dr. [[Edwin Benson]] (1931–2016).<ref name="benson">{{cite news |work=The Missoulian |date=11 May 2009 |first=Jodi |last=Rave |url=http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2009/05/11/news/mtregional/news06.txt |title=The last speaker: UND to honor Mandan, last to speak Nu'eta as 1st language }}</ref> The language is being taught in local school programs to encourage the use of the language.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Last known fluent Mandan speaker honored | work = News From Indian Country | accessdate = 2012-09-27 | url = https://www.indiancountrynews.com/index.php/culture/language/4931-last-known-fluent-mandan-speaker-honored }}</ref> Prior to Benson's death, Estonian linguist Indrek Park worked with him for more than two years to preserve the language as much as possible.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/article/7a41507ead8a4f5a8f32c8b4953285e8 |title = Man known as last fluent speaker of the Mandan language dies |date=16 December 2016 |accessdate=2021-03-11 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The 2020 documentary ''To Save A Language'' portrays Park's efforts to revive the language.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nordische-filmtage.culturebase.org/en_EN/films/16538 |title=To Save a Language |publisher=[[Lübeck Nordic Film Days]] |accessdate=2021-03-11}}</ref>

Mandan is taught at [[Fort Berthold Community College]] along with the [[Hidatsa language|Hidatsa]] and [[Arikara language]]s.<ref name="benson" /> Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the [[University of Utah]] has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. As of 2007, extensive materials in the Mandan language at the college and at the [[North Dakota Heritage Center]], in [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], remained to be processed, according to linguists.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Rancher, linguist working to preserve Mandan language | work = News From Indian Country | accessdate = 2012-09-27 | date = 2007-08-07| url = https://indiancountrynews.net/index.php/news/76-culture/native-language/1144-rancher-linguist-working-to-preserve-mandan-language-8-07 9}}</ref>

The MHA Language Project has created language learning materials for Mandan, including a vocabulary app, a dictionary, and several books in the language. They also provide a summer learning institute and materials for teachers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mandanlanguage.org/ |title=Home|website=MHA Language Project - Mandan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

==Classification==
Mandan was initially thought to be closely related to [[Hidatsa language|Hidatsa]] and [[Crow language|Crow]]. However, since Mandan has had [[language contact]] with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. Thus, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.

Mandan has two main [[dialect]]s: Nuptare and Nuetare.

Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. In 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive.<ref name="speakers">Personal communication from Mauricio Mixco in 1999, reported in Parks & Rankin. 2001. p. 112.</ref> [[Edwin Benson]], the last surviving fluent Mandan speaker, died in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Edwin-Benson-last-known-fluent-speaker-of-Mandan-passes-away-at-85-405723515.html |title=Edwin Benson, last-known fluent speaker of Mandan, passes away at 85|last=Skurzewski|first=Joe|publisher=kfyrtv.com|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref>

The language received much attention from White Americans because of the supposedly lighter skin color of the Mandan people, which they speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the 1830s [[Prince Maximilian of Wied]] spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and prepared a comparison list of Mandan and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] words (he thought that the Mandan might be displaced Welsh).<ref name="maximilian">Chafe. 1976b. pp. 37–38.</ref> The idea of a Mandan/Welsh connection was also supported by [[George Catlin]].<ref>[[George Catlin|Catlin, G.]] ''Die Indianer Nordamerikas'' Verlag Lothar Borowsky</ref>

Will and Spinden (p.&nbsp;188) reports that the [[medicine men]] had their own secret language.

==Morphology==

Mandan is a [[subject–object–verb]] language.

Mandan has a system of [[allocutive agreement]] and so different grammatical forms may be used that depend on the [[gender]] of the [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|addressee]]. Questions asked of men must use the [[suffix]] ''-oʔsha:'' the suffix ''-oʔną'' is used to ask of women. Likewise, the [[indicative]] suffix is ''-oʔsh'' to address men, ''-oʔre'' to address women. The same goes for the [[Imperative mood|imperative]]: ''-ta'' (male), ''-ną'' (female).<ref name="gender">Hollow. 1970. p. 457 (in Mithun 1999. p. 280).</ref>

Mandan verbs include a set of postural verbs, which encode the shapes of the subject of the verb:<ref name="mithun2001">{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | pages = 115–116 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}</ref>

The English translations are not "A pot was sitting there," "A big village stood there," or "The river lay there." That reflects the fact that the postural categorization is required in such Mandan [[locative]] statements.

==Vocabulary==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of [[sound symbolism]] in its vocabulary. A {{IPA|/s/}} sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} denotes medium-ness, {{IPA|/x/}} denotes largeness/greater intensity:<ref name="soundsymb">Hollow & Parks 1980. p. 82.</ref>
* ''síire'' "yellow"
* ''shíire'' "tawny"
* ''xíire'' "brown"
* ''seró'' "tinkle"
* ''xeró'' "rattle"
