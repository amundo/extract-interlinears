'''Sunwar''', '''Sunuwar''', or '''Kõinch''' ({{Lang|suz|कोँइच}}; {{Transl|suz|ISO|kõich}}; other spellings are Koinch and Koincha), is a [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] language spoken in [[Nepal]] and [[India]] by the [[Sunuwar people]]. It was first comprehensively attested by the [[Himalayan Languages Project]]. It is also known as Kõits Lo ({{Lang|suz|कोँइच लो}} ; {{Transl|suz|ISO|kõica lo}}), Kiranti-Kõits ({{Lang|suz|किराँती-कोँइच}} ; {{Transl|suz|ISO|kirā̃tī-kõich}}), Mukhiya ({{Lang|suz|मुखिया}} ; {{Transl|suz|ISO|mukhiyā}}).<ref name="OG-Sunuwar">{{Cite web|last1=Ager|first1=Simon|title=Sunuwar alphabet|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sunuwar.htm|publisher=Omniglot|access-date=8 December 2021}}</ref><ref name="Borchers 1–2">{{Cite book|last1=Borchers|first1=Dörte|title=A grammar of Sunwar: descriptive grammar, paradigms, texts and glossary|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-16709-4|pages=1–2|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>

The Sunwar language is one of the smaller members of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] language family. About 40,000 speakers are residing in eastern Nepal.
== Names ==
The language is commonly known as ''Koic,'' for many ethnic Sunwar and Sunwar speakers also refer to the language as “''Sunuwar, Kõinch''<ref name="OG-Sunwar">{{Cite web|last1=Ager|first1=Simon|title=Sunwar Language and Alphabet|url=https://www.omniglot.com/writing/sunwar.htm|publisher=Omniglot|access-date=8 December 2021}}</ref> '', Koinch'' or ''Koincha'' (कोँइच); ''Kõits Lo'' (कोँइच लो), ''Kiranti-Kõits'' (किराँती-कोँइच) or ''Mukhiya'' (मुखिया).”

Moreover, most Sunwar speakers have the surname (सुनुवार), ''Sunuvār'' in [[Latin script]].<ref name="Borchers-2008">{{Cite book|last=Borchers|first=Dörte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYA7CpILphoC|title=A Grammar of Sunwar: Descriptive Grammar, Paradigms, Texts and Glossary|date=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16709-4|language=en}}</ref> Many affiliated Sunwar with Sunar; they share the initial syllable, ''sun'', “gold,” in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], similar to the Sunar community of India, who are goldsmiths. However, the ethnonym ''Sunuvār'' is believed to be connected with Sunkosi, a river nearby the Sunwar villages.

== Geographic distribution ==
[[File:Nepal-ethnic-groups-map.jpg|left|thumb|317x317px|Small groups of Sunwar speakers located in Nepal]]
[[File:Likhu-khola.JPG|thumb|Likhu Khola river]]

The Sunwar language is commonly spoken in a cluster of Sunwar villages, located around the region of the core spoken language. These villages are scattered alongside the river banks of [[Likhu Khola]], in two bordering central-eastern districts of Nepal, distant from the main Nepalese road system:<ref name="Borchers-2008"/> in the [[Okhaldhunga District|Okhaldhū۠ngā District]] (part of [[Province No. 1]]), around the village of Vacul; and in the [[Ramechhap District|Rāmechāp District]] (part of [[Bagmati Province]]), around the villages of [[Paharilotar|Pahare]] and of [[Kubukasthali|Kũbhu Kãsthālī]] for a smaller group of Sunwar speakers. The majority of the Sunwar speakers live on the southern border area of this region, between the villages of Pahare and Vacul.

Located 1,800 meters above sea level, their fields aren’t all fallow from year round cultivation<ref name="Borchers-2008"/> (Borchers, 2008). Therefore, many Sunwar households are farmers, own a small lot of land and livestock. Moreover, each village often visits their neighboring village markets to purchase inaccessible goods such as spices, sugar, tea, and salt. In the winter, they experience no snow but freezing temperatures. In warmer weather, they experience a lot of rainfall, in the summer, monsoon rainfall. Especially between June and August, it is when they experience the most rain, more so monsoon rainfall.

According to Borchers, there are other villages located outside of the core region. The Surel are claimed to be Sunwar speakers however there are no certainties that it is true.

==Written language==

=== {{Anchor|Sunuwar-script}} Sunuwar (or Jenticha, Koĩts, Mukhiya) native alphabet in Sikkim, India ===
Sunuwar speakers from [[Sikkim]], northeastern [[India]], use the Sunuwar alphabet ([[ISO 15924]] script code: <kbd>Sunu</kbd>) for printed materials such as newspapers and literature. The alphabet, also known as Jenticha alphabet, Sunuwar Lipi, Koĩts Lipi or Mukhiya script, or जेँःतिच ब्रेःसे (''jẽtica brese''), was developed in 1942 by Karna Bahadur Sunuwar (1926-1991), and got official recognition in Sikkim and Eastern Nepal where it is taught in schools. The Sunuwar or Jenticha script, is unrelated to any other scripts (even if some letter shapes have some resemblance to Latin and Limbu letter forms with similar phonetic value), and behaves like an alphabet with 35 base letters, written left-to-right, with syllabic features, extended with combining diacritics. The script also features its own set of decimal digits.

Unlike other Indic scripts derived from Brahmic, the Sunuwar alphabet includes no combining vowel signs: the script was initially a pure alphabet and the base consonants initially did not have any inherent vowel. But a second version of the script modified the orthographic rules to imply its presence, where the inherent vowel would be altered when appending any independent vowel letters, or suppressed by using a virama (or halant) sign in some consonant clusters or for consonants in final position of syllables. The independent letter form for the inherent vowel is now removed in most cases from the normal orthography in the middle of words, only used in isolation (i.e. no longer written when following a leading consonant, unless it is at end of words). A number of glyphic forms (conjuncts using consonants in half forms) were added to the script after this orthographic change for more easily writing consonant clusters, instead of writing multiple consonants with virama signs.<ref name="OG-Sunuwar"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Jenticha|url=https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&uid=ssw8skfwtg|publisher=ScriptSource.org|access-date=8 December 2021}}</ref>

=== Devanagari-based abugida for the Sunwar language in Nepal ===
Although Sunwar has no traditional written language in Nepal, most literate speakers use the [[Devanagari]] abugida,<ref name="Borchers-2008"/><ref name="OG-Sunwar"/> also used for writing [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

==Language structure==
In [[linguistic typology]], a '''subject+object+verb''' ('''SOV''') language is one in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], and [[verb]] of a sentence always or usually appear in that order. If [[English language|English]] were SOV, "Sam oranges ate" would be an ordinary sentence, as opposed to the actual [[Standard English]] "Sam ate oranges". (A Grammar of Sunwar)
