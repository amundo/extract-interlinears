** Image: {{Mousetext|[[File:Monggol kele.svg|25px|text-top]]|mongɣol kele}}}} is the official language of [[Mongolia]] and both the most widely spoken and best-known member of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language family]]. The number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5.2 million, including the vast majority of the residents of [[Mongolia]] and many of the [[Mongols in China|ethnic Mongol]] residents of the [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of [[China]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Estimate from Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 141.</ref> In Mongolia, the [[Khalkha Mongolian|Khalkha dialect]] is predominant, and is currently written in both [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Mongolian script|traditional Mongolian script]] (and at times in [[Latin script|Latin]] for [[Social networking service|social networking]]). In Inner Mongolia, the language is [[dialect]]ally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script.

In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools), but much of what is to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially [[Chakhar Mongolian|Chakhar]].

Some classify several other Mongolic languages like [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and [[Oirat language|Oirat]] as dialects of Mongolian, but this classification is not in line with the current international standard.

Mongolian has [[vowel harmony]] and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical [[agglutinative language]] that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, [[Subject–object–verb|subject–object–predicate]], ordering among [[noun phrase]]s is relatively free, as grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight [[grammatical case]]s. There are five [[Voice (grammar)|voices]]. Verbs are marked for voice, [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Modality (linguistics)|epistemic modality]]/[[evidentiality]]. In sentence linking, a special role is played by [[converb]]s.

Modern Mongolian evolved from [[Middle Mongol]], the language spoken in the [[Mongol Empire]] of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the transition, a major shift in the vowel-harmony paradigm occurred, [[Vowel length|long vowels]] developed, the case system changed slightly, and the verbal system was restructured. Mongolian is related to the extinct [[Khitan language]]. It was believed that Mongolian is related to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japonic languages]] but this view is now seen as obsolete by a majority of (but not all) comparative linguists. These languages have been grouped under the [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]] and contrasted with the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]]. However, instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed that Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages form a ''[[Sprachbund]]'', rather than common origin.<ref name=clauson56>Gerard Clauson (1956). "[http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/CLAUSON/Clauson_against.pdf The case against the Altaic theory]". ''Central Asiatic Journal'' volume 2, pages 181–187</ref> [[Mongolian literature]] is well attested in written form from the 13th century but has earlier Mongolic precursors in the literature of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and other [[Xianbei]] peoples. The [[Bugut inscription]] dated to 584 CE and the [[Inscription of Hüis Tolgoi]] dated to 604-620 CE appear to be the oldest substantial Mongolic or Para-Mongolic texts discovered.

==Geographic distribution==
Mongolian is the official national language of [[Mongolia]], where it is spoken (but not always written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate),<ref name="Mongolian">{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=11|chapter=1}}</ref> and the official provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of [[Inner Mongolia]], China, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tsung|first1=Linda|title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China|date=October 27, 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|page=59|chapter=3}}</ref> Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate)<ref name="Mongolian"/> However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late [[Qing]] period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tsung|first1=Linda|title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China|date=October 27, 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|chapter=3}}</ref> However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|last2=Bilik|first2=Naran|last3=Fei|first3=Guo|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|page=84|chapter=4}}</ref> The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=16|chapter=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Otsuka|first1=Hitomi|title=More Morphologies: Contributions to the Festival of Languages, Bremen, 17 Sep to 7 Oct, 2009|date=30 Nov 2012|page=99|chapter=6}}</ref> Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.<ref name="Mongolian"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=56, 64–67|chapter=3}}</ref> The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=11|chapter=1}}{{cite book|last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|last2=Bilik|first2=Naran|last3=Fei|first3=Guo|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|page=61|chapter=3}}</ref> In 2020, the Chinese government required three subjects — language and literature, politics, and history — to be taught in Mandarin in Mongolian language primary and secondary schools in the Inner Mongolia since September, which caused widespread protests among ethnic Mongol communities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shih |first1=Gerry |title=Chinese authorities face widespread anger in Inner Mongolia after requiring Mandarin-language classes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-authorities-face-widespread-anger-in-inner-mongolia-after-requiring-mandarin-language-classes/2020/08/31/3ba5a938-eb5b-11ea-bd08-1b10132b458f_story.html |access-date=1 September 2020 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Qin |first1=Amy |title=Curbs on Mongolian Language Teaching Prompt Large Protests in China |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/world/asia/china-protest-mongolian-language-schools.html |access-date=1 September 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=August 31, 2020}}</ref> These protests were quickly suppressed by the Chinese government.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Feng |first1=Emily |title=Parents Keep Children Home As China Limits Mongolian Language In The Classroom |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/16/912623822/parents-keep-children-home-as-china-limits-mongolian-language-in-the-classroom |access-date=17 September 2020 |work=NPR |date=16 September 2020}}</ref>

==Classification and dialects==
[[File:Ulan Bator 14.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mongolian script]] and [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian Cyrillic]] on [[Damdin Sükhbaatar|Sukhbaatar's]] statue in [[Ulaanbaatar]]]]
[[File:MongolicLanguagesGraph.svg|thumb|left|Modern Mongolian's place on the chronological tree of Mongolic languages]]

Mongolian belongs to the [[Mongolic languages]]. The delimitation of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded by the fact that existing data for the major [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the [[Historical linguistics|historical]] development of the Mongolian [[dialect continuum]], as well as for its [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed,<ref>See especially Rinčjen 1979, Amaržargal 1988, Coloo 1988 and for a general bibliography on Mongolic phonology Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 218–229.</ref> the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphosyntactic]] study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as [[Khalkha Mongolian|Khalkha]] and Khorchin.<ref>See Ashimura 2002 for a rare piece of research into dialect morphosyntax that shows significant differences between Khalkha and Khorchin.</ref><ref>Janhunen 2003d: 189.</ref>

The status of certain varieties in the Mongolic group—whether they are languages distinct from Mongolian or just dialects of it—is disputed. There are at least three such varieties: [[Oirat language|Oirat]] (including the [[Kalmyk Oirat|Kalmyk variety]]) and [[Buryat language|Buryat]], both of which are spoken in Russia, Mongolia, and China; and [[Ordos Mongolian|Ordos]], spoken around Inner Mongolia's [[Ordos City]].<ref>See Janhunen (ed.) 2003 and Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005 for two classificatory schemes.</ref>

There is no disagreement that the Khalkha dialect of the Mongolian state is Mongolian.<ref>For an exact delimitation of Khalkha, see Amaržargal 1988: 24–25.</ref> Beyond this one point, however, agreement ends. For example, the influential classification of Sanžeev (1953) proposed a "Mongolian language" consisting of just the three dialects Khalkha, [[Chakhar Mongolian|Chakhar]], and Ordos, with Buryat and Oirat judged to be independent languages.<ref>Sanžeev 1953: 27–61, especially 55.</ref>

On the other hand, Luvsanvandan (1959) proposed a much broader "Mongolian language" consisting of a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk), and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties).<ref>Quoted from Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 167–168.</ref> Additionally, the ''Language Policy in the People’s Republic of China: Theory and Practice Since 1949'', states that Mongolian can be classified into four dialects: the Khalkha dialect in the middle, the Horcin-Haracin dialect in the East, Oriat-Hilimag in the west, and Bargu-Buriyad in the north.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XDdBgAAQBAJ&q=Language+Policy+in+the+People%E2%80%99s+Republic+of+China+The+Use+and+Development+of+Mongol+and+its+Writing+Systems+in+China&pg=PA288|title=Language Policy in the People's Republic of China: Theory and Practice Since 1949|last1=Zhou|first1=Minglang|last2=Sun|first2=Hongkai|date=2006-04-11|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-8039-5|language=en}}</ref>

Some Western scholars<ref>among them Janhunen 2003</ref> propose that the relatively well researched Ordos variety is an independent language due to its conservative syllable structure and [[phoneme]] inventory. While the placement of a variety like [[Alasha dialect|Alasha]],<ref>Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 265–266.</ref> which is under the cultural influence of Inner Mongolia but historically tied to Oirat, and of other border varieties like [[Darkhad dialect|Darkhad]] would very likely remain problematic in any classification,<ref>Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 266 classify Alasha as a variety of Southern Mongolian according to morphological criteria, while Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 148 classify it as a variety of Oirat according to phonological criteria. For a discussion of opinions on the classification of Darkhad, see Sanžaa and Tujaa 2001: 33–34.</ref> the central problem remains the question of how to classify Chakhar, Khalkha, and Khorchin in relation to each other and in relation to Buryat and Oirat.<ref>Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 166–73, 184–195. See also Janhunen 2003d: 180.</ref> The split of {{IPA|[tʃ]}} into {{IPA|[tʃ]}} before *i and {{IPA|[ts]}} before all other reconstructed vowels, which is found in Mongolia but not in Inner Mongolia, is often cited as a fundamental distinction,<ref>E.g., Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 143, Poppe 1955: 110–115.</ref> for example [[Proto-Mongolic]] ''{{IPA|*tʃil}}'', Khalkha {{IPA|/tʃiɮ/}}, Chakhar {{IPA|/tʃil/}} 'year' versus Proto-Mongolic ''{{IPA|*tʃøhelen}}'', Khalkha {{IPA|/tso:ɮəŋ/}}, Chakhar {{IPA|/tʃo:ləŋ/}} 'few'.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2006: 159–160; the difference between the [l]s might just be due to the impossibility of reconstructing something as precise as {{IPA|[ɮ]}} for Proto-Mongolic and imprecision or convenience in notation for Chakhar (Chakhar phonemes according to Dobu 1983).</ref> On the other hand, the split between the past tense verbal suffixes -''{{IPA|sŋ}}'' in the Central varieties vs. -''{{IPA|dʒɛː}}'' in the Eastern varieties<ref>E.g., ''bi tegün-i taniǰei'' I him know -{{smallcaps|past}} 'I knew him' is accepted and ?''Bi öčögedür iregsen'' rejected by an Inner Mongolian grammarian from Khorchin (Chuluu 1998: 140, 165); in Khalkha, by contrast, the first sentence would not appear with the meaning attributed to it, while the second is perfectly acceptable.</ref> is usually seen as a merely [[stochastic]] difference.<ref>See, for example, Činggeltei 1959. Notice that this split is blurred by the school grammar, which treats several dialectal varieties as one coherent grammatical system (for example Činggeltei 1999 [1979]). This understanding is in turn reflected in the undecided treatment of -''{{IPA|sŋ}}'' in research work like Bayančoγtu 2002: 306.</ref>

In Inner Mongolia, official language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: [[Southern Mongolian]], Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. Southern Mongolian is said to consist of Chakhar, Ordos, [[Baarin Mongolian|Baarin]], Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a [[Standard language|literary standard]] for Mongolian in whose grammar is said to be based on Southern Mongolian and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the [[Eight Banners|Plain Blue Banner]].<ref>"Öbür mongγul ayalγu bol dumdadu ulus-un mongγul kelen-ü saγuri ayalγu bolqu büged dumdadu ulus-un mongγul kelen-ü barimǰiy-a abiy-a ni čaqar aman ayalγun-du saγurilaγsan bayidaγ." (Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 85).</ref> Dialectologically, however, western Southern Mongolian dialects are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern Southern Mongolian dialects: for example, Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.<ref>Janhunen 2003d.</ref>

Besides Mongolian, or "Central Mongolic", other languages in the Mongolic grouping include [[Dagur language|Dagur]], spoken in eastern [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Heilongjiang]], and in the vicinity of [[Tacheng]] in [[Xinjiang]]; the [[Shirongolic languages|Shirongolic]] subgroup [[Eastern Yugur language|Shira Yugur]], [[Bonan language|Bonan]], [[Santa language|Dongxiang]], [[Monguor language|Monguor]], and [[Kangjia language|Kangjia]], spoken in  [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] regions; and the possibly extinct [[Moghol language|Moghol]] of Afghanistan.<ref>Janhunen 2006, except that Mongghul and Mangghuer are treated as a sub-branch (Slater 2003) and that Kangjia has been added (Siqinchaoketu 1999). Khamnigan which Janhunen groups as a Central Mongolic language is usually not discussed by other scholars.</ref>

As for the classification of the Mongolic family relative to other languages, the Altaic theory (which is increasingly less well received among linguists<ref>For a history of the Altaic theory, see Georg ''et al.'' 1999. Since then, the major pro-Altaistic publication Starostin ''et al.'' 2003 has appeared, which got mostly mildly negative to devastating reviews, the most detailed being Vovin 2005.</ref>) proposes that the Mongolic family is a member of a larger [[Altaic languages|Altaic family]] that would also include the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], and usually [[Koreanic languages]] and [[Japonic languages]] as well.

==== Juha Janhunen – 'Mongolian' book – from 2012 ====
In Juha Janhunen's book titled "Mongolian", he groups the Mongolic language family into 4 distinct linguistic branches:<ref name=":1" />

 |description  = Modern day Mongolians speaking Khalkh, the dominant dialect of Mongolian. Recorded in Tavan Har, Mongolia 
}}

The following description is based primarily on the Khalkha dialect as spoken in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia's capital. The phonologies of other varieties such as Ordos, Khorchin, and even Chakhar, differ considerably.<ref>See Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 249–384.</ref> This section discusses the [[phonology]] of Khalkha Mongolian with subsections on Vowels, Consonants, Phonotactics and Stress.

===Vowels===
The standard language has seven [[monophthong]] vowel phonemes. They are aligned into three [[vowel harmony]] groups by a parameter called ATR ([[Advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]]); the groups are −ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.

Length is phonemic for vowels, and each of the seven phonemes occurs short or long. Phonetically, short {{IPA|/o/}} has become centralized to the [[Close-mid central rounded vowel|central vowel]] {{IPA|[ɵ]}}.

In the following table, the seven vowel phonemes, with their length variants, are arranged and described phonetically. The vowels in the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet are:

Khalkha also has four [[diphthong]]s: historically {{IPA|/ui, ʊi, ɔi, ai/}}, though they may be pronounced more like {{IPA|[ue, ʊe, ɔe, ae]}}.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 22</ref> Vowels can also combine to form a further three diphthongs, and so seven in total: ia (иа), ʊa (уа) ei (эй). For example: aй in далай (sea), иа in амиараа (individually), ой in нохой (dog), уа in хуаран (barracks), уй in уйлах (to cry), үй in үйлдвэр (factory), эй in хэрэгтэй (necessary).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sanders|first=Alan J. K.|title=Colloquial Mongolian : the complete course for beginners|isbn=978-1-317-30598-9|pages=13|oclc=919495714|date=2015-08-14}}</ref>

'''ATR harmony.''' Mongolian divides vowels into three groups in a system of [[vowel harmony]]:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
! +ATR ("front")
! −ATR ("back")
! Neutral
|-
|IPA Characters
| {{IPA|e, u, o}}
| {{IPA|a, ʊ, ɔ}}
|{{IPA|i}}
|-
|Mongolian Cyrillic characters
|э, ү, ө
|а, у, о
|и and й
|}

As mentioned, for historical reasons these have traditionally been labeled as "front" vowels and "back" vowels. Indeed, in [[Romanization|Romanized]] transcription of Mongolian, the vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are often conventionally rendered as {{angle bracket|ö}} and {{angle bracket|ü}}, while the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} are expressed as {{angle bracket|o}} and {{angle bracket|u}} (this is also the case in the nonphonological sections of this article). However, for modern Mongolian phonology, it seems more appropriate to instead characterize the two vowel-harmony groups by the dimension of tongue root position. There is also one neutral vowel, {{IPA|/i/}}, not belonging to either group.

All the vowels in a non[[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word, including all its suffixes, must belong to the same group. If the first vowel is −ATR, then every vowel of the word must be either {{IPA|/i/}} or a −ATR vowel. Likewise, if the first vowel is a +ATR vowel, then every vowel of the word must be either {{IPA|/i/}} or a +ATR vowel. In the case of suffixes, which must change their vowels to conform to different words, two patterns predominate. Some suffixes contain an archiphoneme {{IPA|/A/}} that can be realized as {{IPA|/a, ɔ, e, o/}}. For example:

*{{IPA|orx}} ''household'' + {{IPA|-Ar}} (instrumental) → {{IPA|orxor}} ''by a household''
*{{IPA|xarʊɮ}} ''sentry'' + {{IPA|-Ar}} (instrumental) → {{IPA|xarʊɮar}} ''by a sentry''

Other suffixes can occur in {{IPA|/U/}} being realized as {{IPA|/ʊ, u/}}, in which case all −ATR vowels lead to {{IPA|/ʊ/}} and all +ATR vowels lead to {{IPA|/u/}}. For example:

*{{IPA|aw}} ''to take'' + {{IPA|-Uɮ}} (causative) → {{IPA|awʊɮ}}

If the only vowel in the word stem is {{IPA|/i/}}, the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 43–50.</ref>

'''Rounding harmony.''' Mongolian also has rounding harmony, which does not apply to close vowels. If a stem contains {{IPA|/o/}} (or {{IPA|/ɔ/}}), a suffix that is specified for an open vowel will have {{IPA|[o]}} (or {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, respectively) as well. However, this process is blocked by the presence of {{IPA|/u/}} (or {{IPA|/ʊ/}}) and {{IPA|/ei/}}. E.g. {{IPA|ɔr-ɮɔ}} ''came in'', but {{IPA|ɔr-ʊɮ-ɮa}} ''inserted''.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 46–47, 50–51.</ref>

'''Vowel length.''' The pronunciation of long and short [[vowel]]s depends on the [[syllable]]'s position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] contrast in [[Vowel length|length]]. A long vowel has about 208% the length of a short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is [[Syllabification|determined]] according to [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] requirements.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 1–7, 22–24, 73–75.</ref>

A striking and rare feature among the world's languages, Mongolian lacks the voiced lateral approximant, {{IPA|[l]}} and the voiceless velar plosive {{IPA|[k]}}; instead, it has a [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]], {{IPA|/ɮ/}}, which is often realized as voiceless {{IPA|[ɬ]}}.<ref>Karlsson 2005: 17</ref> In word-final position, {{IPA|/n/}} (if not followed by a vowel in historical forms) is realized as {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. The occurrence of palatalized consonant phonemes seems to be restricted to words that contain [−ATR] vowels.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 20–21, where it is actually stated that they are phonemic only in such words; in Svantesson's analysis, [−ATR] corresponds to "pharyngeal" and [+ATR]—to "nonpharyngeal".</ref> Aspirated consonants are preaspirated in medial and word-final contexts, devoicing preceding consonants and vowels. Devoiced short vowels are often deleted.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/LWPL/article/viewFile/2341/1916|title=Vowels in Mongolian speech: deletions and epenthesis |author=Anastasia Mukhanova Karlsson|access-date=2014-07-26}}</ref>

===Syllable structure and phonotactics===
The maximal [[syllable]] is CVVCCC, where the last C is a word-final suffix. A single short vowel rarely appears in [[Syllable#Coda|syllable-final position]]. If a word was monosyllabic historically, *CV has become CVV. {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is restricted to codas (else it becomes {{IPA|[n]}}), and {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʲ/}} do not occur in codas for historical reasons. For two-consonant clusters, the following restrictions obtain:

* a palatalized consonant can be preceded only by another palatalized consonant or sometimes by {{IPA|/ɢ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}
* {{IPA|/ŋ/}} may precede only {{IPA|/ʃ, x, ɡ, ɡʲ/}} and {{IPA|/ɢ/}}
* {{IPA|/j/}} does not seem to appear in second position
* {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʲ/}} do not occur as first consonant and as second consonant only if preceded by {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/ɮ/}} or their palatalized counterparts.

Clusters that do not conform to these restrictions will be broken up by an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] nonphonemic vowel in a syllabification that takes place from right to left. For example, ''hojor'' 'two', ''ažil'' 'work', and ''saarmag'' 'neutral' are, phonemically, {{IPA|/xɔjr/}}, {{IPA|/atʃɮ/}}, and {{IPA|/saːrmɡ/}} respectively. In such cases, an epenthetic vowel is inserted so as to prevent disallowed consonant clusters. Thus, in the examples given above, the words are phonetically {{IPA|[xɔjɔ̆r]}}, {{IPA|[atʃĭɮ]}}, and {{IPA|[saːrmăɢ]}}. The phonetic form of the epenthetic vowel follows from vowel harmony triggered by the vowel in the preceding syllable. Usually it is a [[Relative articulation#Centralized vowels|centralized]] version of the same sound, with the following exceptions: preceding {{IPA|/u/}} produces {{IPA|[e]}}; {{IPA|/i/}} will be ignored if there is a nonneutral vowel earlier in the word; and a postalveolar or palatalized consonant will be followed by an epenthetic {{IPA|[i]}}, as in {{IPA|[atʃĭɮ]}}.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 62–72.</ref>

===Stress===

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not distinguish different meanings) and thus is considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 95–97</ref> Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.

Walker (1997)<ref>elaborating on Bosson 1964 and Poppe 1970.</ref> proposes that stress falls on the rightmost [[Syllable weight|heavy syllable]] unless this syllable is word-final:

:{|
| H'''ˈH'''LL || {{IPA|[pai.ˈɢʊɮ. ɮəɢ.təx]}} || ''to be organized''
|-
| LH'''ˈH'''L || {{IPA|[xon.ti.ˈru.ɮəŋ]}} || ''separating'' (adverbial)
|-
| LHH'''ˈH'''L || {{IPA|[ʊ.ɮan.paːtʰ.ˈrin.xəŋ]}} || ''the residents of Ulaanbaatar''
|-
| H'''ˈH'''H || {{IPA|[ʊːr.ˈtʰai.ɢar]}} || ''angrily''
|-
| '''ˈH'''LH || {{IPA|[ˈʊitʰ.ɢər.tʰai]}} || ''sad''
|}

A "heavy syllable" is here defined as one that is at least the length of a full vowel; short word-initial syllables are thereby excluded. If a word is bisyllabic and the only heavy syllable is word-final, it gets stressed anyway. In cases where there is only one phonemic short word-initial syllable, even this syllable can get the stress:<ref>Walker's evidence is collected from one native informant, examples from Poppe 1970, and consultation with James Bosson. She defines stress in terms of pitch, duration and intensity. The analysis pertains to the Khalkha dialect. The phonemic analysis in the examples is adjusted to Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005.</ref>

:{|
| L'''ˈH''' || {{IPA|[ɢa.ˈɮʊ]}} || ''goose''
|-
| '''ˈL'''L || {{IPA|[ˈʊnʃ.səŋ]}} || ''having read''
|}

More recently, the most extensive collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies has been applied to a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect.<ref>Harnud [Köke] 2003.</ref><ref>Harnud 2003 was reviewed by J. Brown in ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 2006 Dec, 36(2): 205–207.</ref> The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while [[Fundamental frequency|F0]] seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.<ref>Harnud [Köke] 2003: 44–54, 94–100.</ref>

==Grammar==
The grammar here is also based primarily on Khalkha Mongolian. Unlike the phonology, most of what is said about morphology and syntax also holds true for Chakhar,<ref>See Sečenbaγatur 2003</ref> while Khorchin is somewhat more diverse.<ref>See Bayančoγtu 2002</ref>

=== Forming questions ===
When asking questions in Mongolian, a question marker is used to show a question is being asked. There are different question markers for yes/no questions and for information questions. For yes/no questions, {{lang|mn|уу}} and {{lang|mn|үү}} are used when the last word ends in a short vowel or a consonant, and their use depends on the vowel harmony of the previous word. When the last word ends in a long vowel or a diphthong, then {{lang|mn|юу}} and {{lang|mn|юү}} are used (again depending on vowel harmony). For information questions (questions asking for information with an interrogative word like who, what, when, where, why, etc.), the question particles are {{lang|mn|вэ}} and {{lang|mn|бэ}}, depending on the last sound in the previous word.

# Yes/No Question Particles -{{lang|mn|уу/үү/юу/юү}} ({{transl|mn|uu/üü/yuu/yuü}})
# Open Ended Question Particles -{{lang|mn|бэ/вэ}} ({{transl|mn|be/ve}})

'''Basic interrogative pronouns''' -{{lang|mn|юу}} ({{transl|mn|yuu}}; 'what'), -{{lang|mn|хаана}} ({{transl|mn|khaana}}; 'where'), {{lang|mn|хэн}} ({{transl|mn|khen}}; 'who'), {{lang|mn|яагаад}} ({{transl|mn|yaagaad}}; 'why'), {{lang|mn|яаж}} ({{transl|mn|yaaj}}; 'how'), {{lang|mn|хэзээ}} ({{transl|mn|khezee}}; 'when'), {{lang|mn|ямар}} ({{transl|mn|yamar}}; 'what kind')

=== Verbs ===
In Mongolian, verbs have a stem and an ending. For example, {{lang|mn|бай}}, {{lang|mn|сур}}, and {{lang|mn|үзэ}} are the stems and take the following endings: {{lang|mn|х}}, {{lang|mn|ах}}, and {{lang|mn|х}} respectively: {{lang|mn|байx}}, {{lang|mn|сурax}}, and {{lang|mn|үзэx}}. These are the infinitive or dictionary forms.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Gaunt|first1=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYCVMYOAMKEC|title=Modern Mongolian: A Course-book|last2=Bayarmandakh|first2=L.|last3=Chuluunbaatar|first3=L.|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1305-9|pages=xv/13 (depending on ebook or physical / xvi/14|language=en}}</ref> The present/future tense is formed by adding either {{lang|mn|на}}, {{lang|mn|но}}, {{lang|mn|нэ}}, or {{lang|mn|нө}} to the stem. These do not change for different pronouns, so {{lang|mn|сурна}} (I/you/he/she/we/you all/they study) will always be {{lang|mn|сурна}}. {{lang|mn|байна}} is the present/future tense verb for to be. {{lang|mn|уншина}} is to read. {{lang|mn|үзнэ}} is to see. The final vowel is barely pronounced and is not pronounced at all if the word after begins with a vowel, so {{lang|mn|сайн байна уу}} is pronounced sain bain uu.<ref name=":0" />

# Past Tense -{{lang|mn|сан/сон/сэн/сөн}} ({{transl|mn|san/son/sen/sön}})
# Informed Past Tense (any point in past) -{{lang|mn|в}} ({{transl|mn|v}})
# Informed Past Tense (not long ago) -{{lang|mn|лаа/лоо/лээ/лөө}} ({{transl|mn|laa/loo/lee/löö}})
# Non-Informed Past Tense (generally a slightly to relatively more distant past) -{{lang|mn|жээ/чээ}} ({{transl|mn|jee/chee}})
# Present Perfect Tense -{{lang|mn|даг/дог/дэг/дөг}} ({{transl|mn|dag/dog/deg/dög}})
# Present Progressive Tense -{{lang|mn|ж/ч байна}} ({{transl|mn|j/ch baina}})
# (Reflective) Present Progressive Tense -{{lang|mn|аа/оо/ээ/өө}} ({{transl|mn|aa/oo/ee/öö}})
# Simple Present Tense -{{lang|mn|на/но/нэ/нө}} ({{transl|mn|na/no/ne/nö}})
# Simple Future -{{lang|mn|х (+болно)}} ({{transl|mn|kh (+bolno)}})
# Infinitive Tense -{{lang|mn|х}} ({{transl|mn|kh}})

=== Negative form ===
There are several ways to form negatives in Mongolian.<ref name="Gaunt, John. 2006">{{Cite book|last=Gaunt, John.|title=Modern Mongolian : a course-book|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1305-0|oclc=615102455}}</ref> For example:

# {{lang|mn|биш}} ({{transl|mn|bish}}) – the negative form of the verb 'to be' ({{lang|mn|байх}} {{transl|mn|baikh}}) – {{lang|mn|биш}} means 'is/are not'.
# -{{lang|mn|гүй}} ({{transl|mn|güi}}). This suffix is added to verbs, for example {{lang|mn|явах}} ({{transl|mn|yavakh}} – go/will go) becomes {{lang|mn|явахгүй}} ({{transl|mn|yavakhgüi}} – do not go/will not go).
# {{lang|mn|үгүй}} ({{transl|mn|ügüi}}) is the word for 'no' in Mongolian
# {{lang|mn|битгий}} ({{transl|mn|bitgii}}) is used for negative imperatives, for example {{lang|mn|битгий яваарай}} ({{transl|mn|bitgii yavaarai}} – don't go)
# {{lang|mn|бүү}} ({{transl|mn|büü}}) is the formal version of {{lang|mn|битгий}}.

===Morphology===
Modern Mongolian is an [[agglutination|agglutinative]], almost exclusively suffixing language, the only exception being reduplication.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 58–59.</ref> Mongolian also does not have gendered nouns, or definite articles like "the".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguamongolia.com/gram1.html?LMCL=SOaskU|title=Grammar|website=www.linguamongolia.com|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> Most of the suffixes consist of a single [[morpheme]]. There are many [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al morphemes.<ref>Sečen 2004.</ref> For example, the word {{Transl|mn|bajguullagynh}} consists of the root {{Transl|mn|baj}}- 'to be', an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] -{{Transl|mn|g}}-, the [[causative]] -{{Transl|mn|uul}}- (hence 'to found'), the [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]] suffix -{{Transl|mn|laga}} that forms nouns created by the action (like -''ation'' in 'organisation') and the complex suffix –{{Transl|mn|ynh}} denoting something that belongs to the modified word (-{{Transl|mn|yn}} would be [[genitive case|genitive]]).

Nominal [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] are quite frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]], e.g. {{Transl|mn|jar<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}- 'to speak', {{Transl|mn|jarilts}}- 'to speak with each other'. Formally, the independent words derived using verbal suffixes can roughly be divided into three classes: final [[verb]]s, which can only be used sentence-finally, i.e. -{{Transl|mn|na}} (mainly future or generic statements) or –{{Transl|mn|ø}} (second person imperative);<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 151–153, 161–163.</ref> [[participle]]s (often called "verbal nouns"), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. -{{Transl|mn|san}} ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]-[[past tense|past]])<ref>Hashimoto 1993.</ref> or -{{Transl|mn|maar}} ('want to'); and [[converb]]s, which can link clauses or function [[adverbial]]ly, i.e. -{{Transl|mn|ž}} (qualifies for any adverbial function or neutrally connects two [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]) or -{{Transl|mn|tal}} (the action of the main [[clause]] takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 103–104, 124–125, 130–131.</ref>

Roughly speaking, Mongolian has eight [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]] ([[markedness|unmarked]]), [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[comitative case|comitative]] and [[allative case|directional]].<ref>Tsedendamba and Möömöö 1997: 222–232.</ref> If a direct object is [[definiteness|definite]], it must take the accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is [[Definiteness|unspecific]].<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 61. The exact conditions of use for indefinite specific direct objects have not yet been specified in detail, but they appear to be related to animacy and textual context.</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303336972|title=Differential object marking in Mongolian|last=Guntsetseg|first=Dolgor|date=January 2008|website=Research Gate|access-date=14 March 2020}}</ref> In addition to case, a number of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]] exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -{{Transl|mn|Vn}} either for lexical historical reasons or [[analogy]] (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix).<ref>Sečenbaγatur 2003: 32–46.</ref> [[Noun]]s can take reflexive-possessive [[clitic]]s indicating that the marked noun is possessed by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence: {{Transl|mn|bi najz(-)aa avarsan}} I friend-{{smallcaps|reflexive-possessive}} save-{{smallcaps|perfect}} 'I saved my friend'.<ref>Tsedendamba and Möömöö 1997: 234–241.</ref> However, there are also somewhat noun-like [[adjective]]s to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]].<ref>For a pioneering approach to this problem, see Sajto 1999.</ref>

'''Nominative case'''

The nominative case is used when a noun (or other part of speech acting as one) is the subject of the sentence, and the agent of whatever action (not just physically) takes place in the sentence. In Mongolian, the nominative case does not have an ending.

'''Accusative case'''

The accusative case is used when a noun acts as a direct object (or just “object”), and receives action from a transitive verb. It is formed by adding one of the following endings: -{{Lang|mn|ийг}} (-{{Transl|mn|iig}}), -{{Lang|mn|ыг}} (-{{Transl|mn|iig}}), -{{Lang|mn|г}} (-{{Transl|mn|g}}).

==== Genitive case ====
The genitive case is used to show possession of something. It is formed by adding one of the following endings: -н (n) -ы (i) -ий (ii) -ийн (iin) -ын (in) -гийн (giin).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaunt, John.|title=Modern Mongolian : a course-book|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1305-0|pages=xxv (13 depending on ebook/physical book) / xxvi (14 depending on ebook/physical book)|oclc=615102455}}</ref> For example:

# -н (n) is added to all words which end with a diphthong or ий (ii).
# -ы (i) is added to back vowel words ending in -н (n).
# -ий (ii) is added to front vowel words ending in н (n). 
# -ийн (iin) is added to front vowel words ending in short vowels or consonants (except those ending in н), and to back vowel words ending in ж, ч, ш, г, ь, и, and the short vowel will be dropped. 
# -ын (in) is added to all other back vowel words ending with short vowels or other consonants (except those ending in н).
# -гийн (giin) is added to all front and back vowel word ending with long vowels.

==== Dative/locative case ====
The dative/locative case is used to show the location of something. It is formed by adding one of the following endings to the stem of a word: ''-''д (d), ''-''ад (ad), -ид (id), ''-''т (t).<ref name="Gaunt, John. 2006"/> For example:

# ''-''д (d) is added to words ending in a vowel, or -м, -н. -л.
# ''-''ад (ad) is added to words ending in -д, -з, -ц, -с. -т, -х.
# -ид (id) is added to words ending in -ш, -ж or -ч.
# -т (t) is added to words ending in -р, -г, or -с (only when -c has a vowel before it).

==== Plurals ====
Source:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/linguistics35/home/mongolian-grammar#TOC-Plural|title=Mongolian Grammar - Linguistics 35|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>
[[Plural]]ity may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.<ref>Tsedendamba and Möömöö 1997: 210–219, Sečenbaγatur 2003: 23–29.</ref>

There are four ways of forming plurals in Mongolian:

# Some plurals are formed by adding ''noːd'' or ''-nuːd'' (нууд or нүүд - ''nuud'' or ''nüüd''). If the last vowel of the previous word is a (a), o (y), or ɔ (o), then -noːd (нууд) is used. For example, харx (kharkh - rat) becomes xapхнууд (kharkhnuud - rats). If the last vowel of the previous word is e (э), ʊ (ө), ü (ү), or i (и) then ''-nuːd'' (нүүд) is used: for example, нүд (eye) becomes нүднүүд (eyes - nüdnüüd).
# In other plurals, just ''-oːd'' or ''-uːd'' is added with no "n" included. For example, хот (city - khot) becomes хотууд (cities - khotuud), and ээж (mother - eej) becomes ээжүүд (mothers - eejüüd).
# Another way of forming plurals is adding ''-nar.'' For example, багш (teacher - bagsh) becomes багш нар (teachers - bagsh nar). 
# The final way is an irregular form used: хүн (khün - person) becomes хүмүүс (khümüüs - people).

[[Personal pronoun]]s exist for the first and second person, while the old [[demonstrative pronoun]]s have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include [[interrogative pronoun]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] (which take participles), [[spatials]], and [[grammatical particle|particles]], the last being rather numerous.<ref>This is a simplified treatment of word classes. For a more precise treatment within the descriptive framework common in Inner Mongolia, see Sečenbaγatur 2003.</ref>

[[negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is mostly expressed by ''-güi'' (-гүй) after participles and by the negation particle ''bish'' after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding the verb (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend to be replaced by analytical constructions.<ref>For the historic background of negation, see Yu 1991. For a phenomenology, see Bjambasan 2001.</ref>

===Syntax===

==== Differential case marking ====
Mongolian uses differential case marking, being a regular [[Differential object marking|Differential Object Marking]] (DOM) language. DOM emerges from a complicated interaction of factors such as [[referentiality]], [[animacy]] and [[Topic and comment|topicality]].

Mongolian also exhibits a specific type of [[Differential Subject Marking]] (DSM), in which the subjects of embedded clauses (including adverbial clauses) occur with accusative case.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Guntsetseg|first=Dolgor|title=Differential Case Marking in Mongolian|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303336972|access-date=16 March 2020|website=Research Gate}}</ref>

====Phrase structure====
The [[noun phrase]] has the order: demonstrative pronoun/[[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]], adjective, noun.<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 55.</ref><ref name=":2" /> Attributive sentences precede the whole NP. Titles or occupations of people, low numerals indicating groups, and [[topic–comment|focus]] clitics are put behind the head noun.<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 237, 347.</ref> [[Possessive pronoun]]s (in different forms) may either precede or follow the NP.<ref>Svantesson 2003: 164–165.</ref> Examples:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|bid-nij uulz-san ter sajhan zaluu-gaas č
|we-GEN meet-PRF that beautiful young.man-ABL FOC
|'even from that beautiful young man that we have met'}}

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Dorž bagš maan<nowiki>'</nowiki>
|Dorj teacher our
|'our teacher Dorj'}}

The verbal phrase consists of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in the center, preceded by its [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] and by the adverbials modifying it and followed (mainly if the predicate is sentence-final) by [[modal particle]]s,<ref>See Mönh-Amgalan 1998.</ref> as in the following example with predicate ''bičsen'':

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ter hel-eh-güj-geer üün-ijg bič-sen šüü
|s/he without:saying it-ACC write-PRF PTC
|'s/he wrote it without saying [so] [i.e. without saying that s/he would do so, or that s/he had done so], I can assure you.'}}

In this clause the adverbial, ''helehgüjgeer'' 'without saying [so]' must precede the predicate's complement, ''üünijg'' 'it-{{smallcaps|accusative}}' in order to avoid syntactic ambiguity, since ''helehgüjgeer'' is itself derived from a verb and hence an ''üünijg'' preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as ''hurdan'' 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.<ref>Sečenbaγatur 2003: 167.</ref>

For Khalkha, the most complete treatment of the verbal forms is Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987. However, the analysis of predication presented here, while valid for Khalkha, is adapted from the description of Khorchin by Matsuoka 2007.

Most often, of course, the predicate consists of a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, with or without a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].<ref>Hashimoto 2004</ref> [[coverb|Auxiliaries]] that express direction and [[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]] (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g.
{{interlinear|indent=3
|uuž orhison
|drink-CVB leave-PERF
|'drank up'}}

The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, ''baj-'' 'to be', e.g.
{{interlinear|indent=3
|ter güjž bajna
|s/he run-CVB be-{{gcl|NPAST|nonpast}}
|'she is running'}}

Suffixes occupying this position express [[grammatical aspect]], e.g., [[progressive aspect|progressive]] and [[resultative]]. In the next position, participles followed by ''baj-'' may follow, e.g.,
{{interlinear|indent=3
|ter irsen bajna
|s/he come-PERF be-{{gcl|NPAST|nonpast}}
|'he has come'}}

Here, an explicit [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.

====Clauses====
Unmarked phrase order is [[subject (grammar)|subject]]–[[object (grammar)|object]]–predicate.<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 54.</ref><ref name=":2" /> While the predicate generally has to remain in clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear.<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 88, 363–364.</ref> The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather at the end of the clause.<ref>Apatoczky 2005.</ref> Topic can be overtly marked with ''bol'', which can also mark contrastive focus,<ref>Hammar 1983: 45–80.</ref> overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic ''č'',<ref>Kang 2000.</ref> and overt restrictive focus with the clitic ''l'' ('only').<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 348–349.</ref>

The inventory of [[Grammatical voice|voices]] in Mongolian consists of passive, [[causative]], [[reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]], [[plurative]], and cooperative. In a passive sentence, the verb takes the suffix -''gd''- and the agent takes either dative or instrumental case, the first of which is more common. In the causative, the verb takes the suffix -''uul''-, the causee (the person caused to do something) in a transitive action (e.g., 'raise') takes dative or instrumental case, and the causee in an intransitive action (e.g., 'rise') takes accusative case. Causative morphology is also used in some passive contexts:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Bi tüün-d huurt-san
|I that.one-DAT fool-CAUS-PRF
|'I was fooled by her/him'.}}

The semantic attribute of [[animacy]] is syntactically important: thus the sentence, 'the bread was eaten by me', which is acceptable in English, would not be acceptable in Mongolian. The reciprocal voice is marked by -''ld''-, the plurative by -''tsgaa''-, and the cooperative by -''lts''-.<ref>Sečenbaγatur 2003: 116–123.</ref>

Mongolian allows for adjectival depictives that relate to either the subject or the direct object, e.g. ''Ljena nücgen untdag'' 'Lena sleeps naked', while adjectival resultatives are marginal.<ref>Brosig 2009.</ref>

====Complex sentences====
One way to conjoin clauses is to have the first clause end in a converb, as in the following example using the converb ''-bol'':

{{interlinear|indent=3
|bid üün-ijg ol-bol čam-d ög-nö
|we it-ACC find-COND.CVB you.FAM-DAT give-FUT
|'if we find it we'll give it to you'}}

Some verbal nouns in the dative (or less often in the instrumental) function very similar to converbs:<ref>Svantesson 2003: 172.</ref> e.g., replacing ''olbol'' in the preceding sentence with ''olohod'' find-{{smallcaps|imperfective-dative}} yields 'when we find it we'll give it to you'. Quite often, postpositions govern complete clauses. In contrast, conjunctions take verbal nouns without case:<ref>See Sečenbaγatur 2003: 176–182 (who uses the term "postposition" for both and the term "conjunction" for junctors).</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=WIT:witnessed
|jadar-san učraas unt-laa
|become.tired-PRF because sleep-WIT.PAST
|'I slept because I was tired'}}

Finally, there is a class of particles, usually clause-initial, that are distinct from conjunctions but that also relate clauses:

{{interlinear|indent=3
|bi olson, harin čamd ögöhgüj
|I find-PRF but you-DAT give-IPFV-NEG
| 'I've found it, but I won't give it to you'.}}

Mongolian has a [[complementizer]] [[auxiliary verb]] ''ge''- very similar to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''to iu''. ''ge''- literally means 'to say' and in converbal form ''gež'' precedes either a psych verb or a verb of saying. As a verbal noun like ''gedeg'' (with ''n<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As ''gene'' it may function as an [[evidentiality|evidentialis]] marker.<ref>Sečenbaγatur 2003: 152–153.</ref>

Mongolian clauses tend to be combined [[parataxis (grammar)|paratactically]], which sometimes gives rise to sentence structures which are subordinative despite resembling coordinative structures in European languages:<ref>Johanson 1995.</ref>

{{interlinear|indent=3
|ter ir-eed namajg üns-sen
|that.one come-CVB I.ACC kiss-PRF
|'S/he came and kissed me.'}}

In the [[subordinate clause]] the subject, if different from the subject of [[main clause]], sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case.<ref>Mizuno 1995.</ref> There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well.<ref>Pürev-Očir 1997: 131.</ref> Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as is the case for all English [[relative clause]]s) usually require that if the subject is not the [[head (linguistics)|head]], then it take the genitive,<ref>Sečenbaγatur 2003: 36.</ref> e.g. ''tüünij idsen hool'' that.one-{{smallcaps|genitive}} eat-{{smallcaps|perfect}} meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.

==Loanwords and coined words==
Mongolian first adopted [[loanword]]s from many languages including [[Old Turkic]], [[Sanskrit]] (these often through [[Uighur language|Uighur]]), [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]],<ref>Temürčereng 2004: 86–99.</ref> [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].<ref>Svantesson 2003: 127.</ref> However, more recent loanwords come from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]],<ref>Temürčereng 2004: 99–102.</ref> and [[Mandarin Chinese]] (mainly in Inner Mongolia).<ref>Öbür mongγul-un yeke surγaγuli 2005: 792–793.</ref> Language commissions of the Mongolian state continuously translate new [[terminology]] into Mongolian,<ref>{{cite web|author=Baabar|title=Yum bolgon nertei|work=Ödriin sonin|date=2008-12-09}}</ref> so as the Mongolian vocabulary now has {{lang|mn-Latn|jerönhijlögč}} 'president' ("generalizer") and {{lang|mn-Latn|šar ajrag}} 'beer' ("yellow kumys"). There are several [[calque|loan translations]], e.g., {{lang|mn-Latn|galt tereg}} 'train' ('fire-having cart') from Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|huǒchē}} ({{lang|zh|火车}}, fire cart) 'train'.<ref>Öbür mongγul-un yeke surγaγuli 2005: 828.</ref> Other loan translations include {{lang|mn-Latn|mön chanar}} (essence) from Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|shízhì}} ({{lang|zh|实质}}, true quality), {{lang|mn-Latn|khün am}} (population) from Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|rénkǒu}} ({{lang|zh|人口}}, person mouth), {{lang|mn-Latn|erdene shish}} (corn, maize) from Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|yùmǐ}} ({{lang|zh|玉米}}, jade rice) and {{lang|mn-Latn|bügd nairamdakh uls}} (republic) from Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|gònghéguó}} ({{lang|zh|共和国}}, public collaboration nation).

In the 20th century there were numerous Russian loanwords concerning daily life: ''doktor'' (doctor), ''shokolad'' (chocolate), ''vagon'' (train wagon), ''kalendar'' (calendar), sistem, ''podvoolk'' (from ''futbolka'', T-shirt), and ''mashin'' (car). In more recent times, due to socio-political changes, Mongolian has loaned various words from English; some which have gradually evolved as official terms: ''menejment'', ''computer'', ''fail'' (file), ''marketing'', ''kredit'', ''onlain'' (online), ''mesej'' (message). Most of the latter are confined to the Mongolian state.

Mongolian also gave out loanwords to other languages. Examples, with Mongolian in brackets, include the following. Persian: ''kheshikchi'' (kheshig, royal guard), ''Gūrkāniyān'' گورکانیان‎ (küregen, son-in-law), ''qarqavol'' قرقاول (girgawl, pheasant), ''jebe'' جبه (jebseg, iron armour), ''nokar'' نوکر (nökör, attendant), ''chedar'' چدار (chödör, hobble), ''daruge'' داروغه (darga, chief commandant), ''keyichi'' قیچی (kayichi, scissors). Uzbek ''orol'' (aral, island). Chinese ''hutong'' 衚衕 (gudum, passageway), ''zhanchi'' 站赤 (jamchi, courier/post station). Middle Chinese ''duk'' 犢 (tugul, calf). Korean ''sura'' 수라 (shüle, royal meal), ''akdae'' 악대 (agta, castrated animal), ''eobjin'' 업진 (ebchigün, chest of an animal). Old English ''cocer'' (köküür, container).  Old French ''quivre'' (köküür, container). Old High German ''Baldrian'' (balchirgan-a, valerian plant). ''Köküür'' and  ''balchirgan-a'' are thought to have been brought to Europe by the Huns or Pannonian Avars.

Despite having a diverse range of loanwords, Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha and Khorchin, within a comparative vocabulary of 452 words of Common Mongolic vocabulary, retain as many as 95% of these native words, contrasting e.g. with Southern Mongolic languages at 39–77% retentions.<ref>Rybatzki 2003a: 385–387</ref>

[[File:Nova N 176 folio 9.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nova N 176]] found in Kyrgyzstan. The manuscript (dating to the 12th century [[Western Liao]]) is written in the Mongolic [[Khitan language]] using cursive [[Khitan large script]]. It has 127 leaves and 15,000 characters.]]

Mongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets, making it a language with one of the largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian ([[Xianbei]], [[Wuhuan]] languages) may have used an indigenous runic script as indicated by Chinese sources. The [[Khitan large script]] adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.

The traditional [[Mongolian script]] was first adopted by [[Temüjin]] in 1204, who recognized the need to represent his own people's language. It developed from the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]] when several members of the Uyghur elite who were brought into the Mongol confederation early on shared their knowledge of their written language with the Mongol imperial clan. Among the Uyghurs sharing that knowledge were [[Tata-tonga]] ({{lang-zh|t=塔塔統阿}}), Bilge Buqa (比俚伽普華), Kara Igach Buyruk (哈剌亦哈赤北魯), and Mengsus (孟速思).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Uyghur Technologists of Writing and Literacy in Mongol China|last=Brose|first=Michael C.|journal=[[T'oung Pao]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|date=2005|series=Second Series|volume=91|issue=4/5|pages=397, 406|doi=10.1163/156853205774910106|jstor=4529015}}</ref> From that time, the script underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementation.

Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state. In 1941, the Latin alphabet was adopted, though it lasted only two months.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnwSEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|chapter=5.

The [[Mongolian Cyrillic script]] was the result of the spreading of Russian influence following the expansion of [[Russian Empire]]. The establishment of [[Soviet Union]] helped the influence persist, and the Cyrillic alphabet was slowly introduced with the effort by Russian/Soviet linguists in collaboration with their Mongolian counterparts. It was made mandatory by government decree in 1941. It has been argued that the introduction of the [[Cyrillic script]], with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government [[literacy]] campaign, which increased the [[literacy rate]] from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950.<ref name=unesco>Batchuluun Yembuu, Khulan Munkh-Erdene. 2005.

In the [[People's Republic of China]], Mongolian is the official language along with [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] in some regions, notably the entire [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 34, 40.</ref> There are two types of written Mongolian used in China: the traditional Mongolian script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the [[Clear Script]], used predominantly among [[Oirats]] in [[Xinjiang]].<ref>Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 398.</ref>

In March 2020, the Mongolian government announced plans to use both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian script in official documents by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mongolia to promote usage of traditional script|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2020-03/19/content_75834583.htm|website=China.org.cn (March 19, 2020)}}</ref><ref>[https://www.montsame.mn/en/read/219358 Official documents to be recorded in both scripts from 2025], Montsame, 18 March 2020.</ref><ref>[http://mongolia.gogo.mn/r/146942 Mongolian Language Law is effective from July 1st], Gogo, 1 July 2015.

Only the [['Phags-pa script]] retains the complete [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]] vowel system.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 111.</ref>]]

The earliest surviving Mongolian text may be the {{ill|Stele of Yisüngge|ru|Чингисов_камень}}, a report on sports composed in [[Mongolian script]] on stone, which is most often dated at 1224 or 1225.<ref>E.g.

The Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as "Guoyu" ({{zh|t=國語}}), which means "National language", a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the [[Manchu language]] during the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Jurchen language]] during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], the [[Khitan language]] during the [[Liao dynasty]], and the [[Xianbei#Language|Xianbei language]] during the [[Northern Wei]] period.

The next distinct period is [[Classical Mongolian language|Classical Mongolian]], which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language with a high degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian [[Kangyur]] and [[Tengyur]]<ref>Janhunen 2003a: 32.</ref> as well as several chronicles.<ref>Okada 1984.</ref> In 1686, the [[Soyombo alphabet]] ([[Buddhist texts]]) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.<ref>Nadmid 1967: 98–102.</ref>
{{Clear}}

===Changes in phonology===

====Consonants====
Research into reconstruction of the consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration<ref>e.g. Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005</ref> or voicing.<ref>e.g. Tömörtogoo 1992</ref> The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and uvular plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, *''/k/'', *''{{IPA|/kʰ/}}'' (~ *''[k]'', *''{{IPA|[qʰ]}}'') are to be reconstructed.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 118–120</ref> One prominent, long-running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (''UM'', ''SM'', ''AM'', and ''Ph'', which were discussed in the preceding section). Word-medial ''/k/'' of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed *''/k/'' for both correspondences, arguing that *''/k/'' was lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were.<ref>e.g. Poppe 1955</ref> More recently, the other possibility has been assumed; namely, that the correspondence between UM ''/k/'' and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, ''/h/'', which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme ''/h/'' that is present in those other scripts.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 118–124.</ref> ''/h/'' (also called ''/x/'') is sometimes assumed to derive from *''{{IPA|/pʰ/}}'', which would also explain zero in ''SM'', ''AM'', ''Ph'' in some instances where ''UM'' indicates /p/; e.g., ''[[Deel (clothing)|debel]]'' > Khalkha ''deel''.<ref>Janhunen 2003c: 6</ref>

The palatal affricates *''č'', *''čʰ'' were fronted in Northern Modern Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha. {{IPA|*''kʰ''}} was [[spirantization|spirantized]] to {{IPA|/x/}} in Ulaanbaatar Khalkha and the Mongolian dialects south of it, e.g. Preclassical Mongolian ''kündü'', reconstructed as ''{{IPA|*kʰynty}}'' 'heavy', became Modern Mongolian {{IPA|/xunt/}}<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 133, 167.</ref> (but in the vicinity of [[Bayankhongor]] and [[Baruun-Urt]], many speakers will say {{IPA|[kʰunt]}}).<ref>Rinchen (ed.) (1979): 210.</ref> Originally word-final *''n'' turned into /ŋ/; if *''{{IPA|n}}'' was originally followed by a vowel that later dropped, it remained unchanged, e.g. ''{{IPA|*kʰen}}'' became {{IPA|/xiŋ/}}, but ''{{IPA|*kʰoina}}'' became {{IPA|/xɔin/}}. After i-breaking, {{IPA|*[ʃ]}} became phonemic. Consonants in words containing back vowels that were followed by ''{{IPA|*i}}'' in Proto-Mongolian became [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] in Modern Mongolian. In some words, word-final ''{{IPA|*n}}'' was dropped with most case forms, but still appears with the ablative, dative and genitive.<ref>Svantesson ''et al.'' 2005: 124, 165–166, 205.</ref>

Only foreign origin words start with the letter ''L'' and none start with the letter ''R''.<ref name="Ramsey1987">{{cite book|author=S. Robert Ramsey|title=The Languages of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E_5nR0SoXoC&pg=PA206|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01468-X|pages=206–}}</ref>

====Vowels====
The standard view is that Proto-Mongolic had ''{{IPA|*i, *e, *y, *ø, *u, *o, *a}}''. According to this view, ''{{IPA|*o}}'' and ''{{IPA|*u}}'' were [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] to {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, then ''{{IPA|*y}}'' and ''{{IPA|*ø}}'' were [[velarization|velarized]] to {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. Thus, the vowel harmony shifted from a velar to a pharyngeal paradigm. ''{{IPA|*i}}'' in the first syllable of back-vocalic words was [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to the following vowel; in word-initial position it became {{IPA|/ja/}}. ''{{IPA|*e}}'' was rounded to {{IPA|*ø}} when followed by ''{{IPA|*y}}''. VhV and VjV sequences where the second vowel was any vowel but ''{{IPA|*i}}'' were monophthongized. In noninitial syllables, short vowels were deleted from the phonetic representation of the word and long vowels became short.<ref>Svantesson 2005: 181, 184, 186–187, 190–195.</ref>

E.g. ''{{IPA|*imahan}}'' (''{{IPA|*i}}'' becomes {{IPA|/ja/}}, ''{{IPA|*h}}'' disappears) > ''{{IPA|*jamaːn}}'' (unstable ''n'' drops; vowel reduction) > /jama(n)/ 'goat'

and ''{{IPA|*emys-}}'' (regressive rounding assimilation) > ''{{IPA|*ømys-}}'' (vowel velarization) > ''{{IPA|*omus-}}'' (vowel reduction) > /oms-/ 'to wear'

This reconstruction has recently{{When|date=November 2016}} been opposed, arguing that vowel developments across the Mongolic languages can be more economically explained starting from basically the same vowel system as Khalkha, only with ''{{IPA|*[ə]}}'' instead of ''*[e]''. Moreover, the sound changes involved in this alternative scenario are more likely from an [[Articulatory phonetics|articulatory]] point of view and early Middle Mongol loans into [[Korean language|Korean]].<ref>Ko 2011</ref>

===Changes in morphology===

====Nominal system====
[[File:Secret history.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|alt=white page with several lines of black Chinese characters running top-down and separated into small groups by spaces. To the left of some of the characters there are small characters such as 舌　and 中. To the right of each line, groups of characters are indicated as such by a "<nowiki>]]</nowiki>"-shaped bracket, and to the right of each such bracket, there are other medium-sized characters|''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' which goes back to a lost Mongolian script original is the only document that allows the reconstruction of agreement in social gender in Middle Mongol.<ref>Tümenčečeg 1990.</ref>]]

In the following discussion, in accordance with a preceding observation, the term "Middle Mongol" is used merely as a cover term for texts written in any of three scripts, Uighur Mongolian script (UM), Chinese (SM), or Arabic (AM).

The case system of Middle Mongol has remained mostly intact down to the present, although important changes occurred with the comitative and the dative and most other case suffixes did undergo slight changes in form, i.e., were shortened.<ref>Rybatzki 2003b: 67, Svantesson 2003: 162.</ref> The Middle Mongol comitative -''luγ-a'' could not be used attributively, but it was replaced by the suffix -''taj'' that originally derived adjectives denoting possession from nouns, e.g. ''mori-tai'' 'having a horse' became ''mor<nowiki>'</nowiki>toj'' 'having a horse/with a horse'. As this adjective functioned parallel to ''ügej'' 'not having', it has been suggested that a "privative case" ('without') has been introduced into Mongolian.<ref>Janhunen 2003c: 27.</ref> There have been three different case suffixes in the dative-locative-directive domain that are grouped in different ways: -''a'' as locative and -''dur'', -''da'' as dative<ref>Rybatzki 2003b: 68.</ref> or -''da'' and -''a'' as dative and -''dur'' as locative,<ref>Garudi 2002: 101–107.</ref> in both cases with some functional overlapping. As -''dur'' seems to be grammaticalized from ''dotur-a'' 'within', thus indicating a span of time,<ref>Toγtambayar 2006: 18–35.</ref> the second account seems to be more likely. Of these, -''da'' was lost, -''dur'' was first reduced to -''du'' and then to -''d''<ref>Toγtambayar 2006: 33–34.</ref> and -''a'' only survived in a few frozen environments.<ref>Norčin ''et al.'' (ed.) 1999: 2217.</ref> Finally, the directive of modern Mongolian, -''ruu'', has been innovated from ''uruγu'' 'downwards'.<ref>Sečenbaγatur ''et al.'' 2005: 228, 386.</ref> Social gender agreement was abandoned.<ref>Rybatzki 2003b: 73, Svantesson 2003: 166.</ref>

====Verbal system====
Middle Mongol had a slightly larger set of declarative finite verb suffix forms<ref>Weiers 1969: Morphologie, §B.II; Svantesson 2003: 166.</ref> and a smaller number of participles, which were less likely to be used as finite predicates.<ref>Weiers 1969: Morphologie, §B.III; Luvsanvandan 1987: 86–104.</ref> The linking converb -''n'' became confined to stable verb combinations,<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 126, Činggeltei 1999: 251–252.</ref> while the number of converbs increased.<ref>Rybatzki 2003b: 77, Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 126–137</ref> The distinction between male, female and plural subjects exhibited by some finite verbal suffixes was lost.<ref>The reconstruction of a social gender distinction is fairly commonplace, see e.g. Rybatzki 2003b: 75. A strong argument for the number distinction between -''ba'' and -''bai'' is made in Tümenčečeg 1990: 103–108 (also see Street 2008), where it is also argued that this has been the case for other suffixes.</ref>

===Changes in syntax===
Neutral word order in clauses with pronominal subject changed from object–predicate–subject to subject–object–predicate, e.g.,

{{interlinear|indent=3|abbreviations=NFUT:nonfuture
|Kökseü sabraq ügü.le-run ayyi yeke uge ugu.le-d ta ... kee-jüü.y
|Kökseü sabraq speak-CVB alas big word speak-PAST you ... say-NFUT
|"Kökseü sabraq spoke saying, 'Alas! You speak a great boast....' "<ref>Street 1957: 14, ''Secret History'' 190.13v.</ref>}}

The syntax of verb negation shifted from negation particles preceding final verbs to a negation particle following participles; thus, as final verbs could no longer be negated, their paradigm of negation was filled by particles.<ref>Yu 1991.</ref> For example, Preclassical Mongolian ''ese irebe'' 'did not come' vs. modern spoken Khalkha Mongolian ''ireegüj'' or ''irsengüj''.
