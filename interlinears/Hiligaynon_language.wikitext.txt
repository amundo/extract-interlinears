'''Hiligaynon''', also often referred to as '''Ilonggo''' or '''Bisaya nga Hiniligaynon/Inilonggo''', is an [[Austronesian language family|Austronesian]] [[regional language]] spoken in the [[Philippines]] by about 9.1 million people, predominantly in [[Western Visayas]] and [[Soccsksargen]], most of whom belong to the [[Hiligaynon people]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hil |title=Hiligaynon |last=Lewis |first=M.

Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the regions of [[Western Visayas]] ([[Iloilo]], [[Capiz]], [[Guimaras]], and [[Negros Occidental]]), as well as in [[South Cotabato]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], and [[North Cotabato]] in [[Soccsksargen]]. It is also spoken in other neighboring [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], such as [[Antique (province)|Antique]] and [[Aklan]] (also in [[Western Visayas]]), [[Negros Oriental]] in [[Central Visayas]], [[Masbate]] in [[Bicol Region]], [[Romblon]] and [[Palawan]] in [[Mimaropa]].  It is also spoken as a second language by [[Karay-a language|Kinaray-a]] speakers in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon]] speakers in [[Aklan]], [[Capiznon]] speakers in [[Capiz]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] speakers in [[Negros Oriental]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |access-date=March 29, 2013}}</ref> There are approximately 9,300,000 people in and out of the [[Philippines]] who are native speakers of Hiligaynon and an additional 5,000,000 capable of speaking it with a substantial degree of proficiency.<ref name="Philippine Census 2000">Philippine Census, 2000.

Aside from "Hiligaynon", the language is also referred to as "Ilonggo" (also spelled ''Ilongo''), particularly in [[Iloilo]] and [[Negros Occidental]]. Many speakers outside Iloilo argue, however, that this is an incorrect usage of the word "Ilonggo".  In precise usage, these people opine that "Ilonggo" should be used only in relation to the ethnolinguistic group of native inhabitants of Iloilo and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers in that place, including their language. The disagreement over the usage of "Ilonggo" to refer to the language extends to Philippine language specialists and native laypeople.<ref name="a1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bj-informatique.com/langtrad.php|title=My Working Language Pairs|website=www.bj-informatique.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206233634/http://www.bj-informatique.com/langtrad.php|archive-date=December 6, 2010|access-date=January 3, 2011}}</ref>

Historically, the term  ''Visayan'' had originally been applied to the people of [[Panay]]; however, in terms of language, "Visayan" is more used today to refer to what is also known as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. As pointed out by [[H. Otley Beyer]] and other anthropologists, the term ''Visayan'' was first applied only to the people of [[Panay]] and to their settlements eastward in the island of [[Negros Island|Negros]] (especially its western portion), and northward in the smaller islands, which now compose the province of [[Romblon]]. In fact, at the early part of [[Spanish Colonization in the Philippines]], the Spaniards used the term ''Visayan'' only for these areas. While the people of [[Cebu]], [[Bohol]] and [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] were for a long time known only as Pintados. The name ''Visayan'' was later extended to these other islands because, as several of the early writers state, their languages are closely allied to the Visayan dialect of [[Panay]].<ref>G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, ''A History of the Orient'', Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, pp. 122-123.</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=December 2020}}
Historical evidence from observations of early Spanish explorers in the Archipelago shows that the nomenclature used to refer to this language had its origin among the people of the coasts or people of the ''Ilawod'' ("''los [naturales] de la playa''"), whom Loarca called ''Yligueynes'' <ref>Cf.  BLAIR, Emma Helen & ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903). The Philippine Islands, 1493–1803. Volume 05 of 55 (1582–1583). Historical introduction and additional notes by Edward Gaylord BOURNE. Cleveland, Ohio: Arthur H. Clark Company. {{ISBN|978-0554259598}}. OCLC 769945704. "Explorations by early navigators, descriptions of the islands and their peoples, their history and records of the Catholic missions, as related in contemporaneous books and manuscripts, showing the political, economic, commercial and religious conditions of those islands from their earliest relations with European nations to the beginning of the nineteenth century.", pp. 120-121.</ref> (or the more popular term ''Hiligaynon'', also referred to by the [[Karay-a people]] as ''"Siná"''). In contrast, the "Kinaray-a" has been used by what the Spanish colonizers called ''Arayas'', which may be a Spanish misconception of the Hiligaynon words ''Iraya'' or ''taga-Iraya'', or the current and more popular version ''Karay-a'' (highlanders - people of ''Iraya''/''highlands'').<ref>Cf. Miguel de Loarca, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (Arevalo, June 1582)  in  BLAIR, Emma Helen & ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903). The Philippine Islands, 1493–1803.

==Dialects==
Similar to many [[Languages of the Philippines|languages in the Philippines]], very little research on [[dialectology]] has been done on Hiligaynon. Some of the widely recognized varieties of the language are Standard or Urban Hiligaynon ([[Iloilo]] provincial and [[Metro Iloilo–Guimaras|Metro Iloilo]] variant), simply called "Ilonggo", Bacolodnon Hiligaynon ([[Metro Bacolod]] variant), Negrense Hiligaynon (provincial [[Negros Occidental]] variant that is composed of three sub-variants: Northern, Central and Southern Negrense Hiligaynon), [[Guimaras]] Hiligaynon, and [[Mindanao]] Hiligaynon.

Some native speakers also consider [[Kinaray-a]] (also known as Hiniraya or Antiqueño) and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon]] as dialects of Hiligaynon; however, these have been classified by linguists as separate (Western) Bisayan languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cps|title=Capiznon|website=ethnologue.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203093113/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cps|archive-date=2013-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=krj|title=Kinaray-a|website=ethnologue.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203145249/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=krj|archive-date=2013-02-03}}</ref>

==Writing system==
[[File:Book of Mormon - Hiligaynon.jpg|thumb|Hiligaynon version of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'']]
Hiligaynon is written using the [[Latin script]]. Until the second half of the 20th century, Hiligaynon was widely written largely following Spanish orthographic conventions.  Nowadays there is no officially recognized standard orthography for the language and different writers may follow different conventions. It is common for the newer generation, however, to write the language based on the current orthographic rules of Filipino.

A noticeable feature of the Spanish-influenced orthography absent in those writing following Filipino's orthography is the use of "c" and "qu" in representing /k/ (now replaced with "k" in all instances) and the absence of the letter "w" (formerly used "u" in certain instances).

The core alphabet consists of 20 letters used for expressing consonants and vowels in Hiligaynon, each of which comes in an upper case and lower case variety.

===Additional symbols===
The apostrophe {{angbr|'}} and hyphen {{angbr|-}} also appear in Hiligaynon writing, and might be considered separate letters.

The hyphen, in particular, is used medially to indicate the [[glottal stop]] ''san-o ''‘when’ ''gab-e'' ‘evening; night’. It is also used to in [[reduplication|reduplicated]] words: ''adlaw-adlaw'' ‘daily, every day’, from ''adlaw'' ‘day, sun’. This marking is not used in reduplicated words whose base is not also used independently, as in ''pispis'' ‘bird’.

Hyphens are also used in words with successive sounds of /g/ and /ŋ/, to separate the letters with the digraph NG. Like in the word ''gin-gaan'' 'was given'; without the hyphen, it would be read as ''gingaan'' /gi.ŋaʔan/ as opposed to /gin.gaʔan/.

In addition, some English letters may be used in borrowed words.

==Grammar==

===Determiners===
Hiligaynon has three types of case markers: [[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[oblique case|oblique]]. These types in turn are divided into personal, that have to do with names of people, and impersonal, that deal with everything else, and further into [[grammatical number|singular]] and plural types, though the plural impersonal case markers are just the singular impersonal case markers + ''mga'' (a contracted spelling for {{IPA|/maŋa/}}), a particle used to denote plurality in Hiligaynon.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hiligaynon Reference Grammar |url=https://archive.org/details/hiligaynonrefere0000wolf |url-access=registration |last=Wolfenden |first=Elmer |year=1971 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=0-87022-867-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hiligaynonrefere0000wolf/page/61 61–67]}}</ref>

(*)The [[article (grammar)|articles]] ''sing'' and ''sing mga'' means the following noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], while ''sang'' tells of a definite noun, like the use of ''a'' in English as opposed to ''the'', however, it is not as common in modern speech, being replaced by ''sang''. It appears in conservative translations of the Bible into Hiligaynon and in traditional or formal speech<br>
(**)The plural personal case markers are not used very often and not even by all speakers. Again, this is an example of a case marker that has fallen largely into disuse, but is still occasionally used when speaking a more traditional form of Hiligaynon, using less Spanish loan words.{{clarify|reason=Which determiners are used instead? Plural impersonal, singular personal, singular personal + mga?|date=July 2018}}

The case markers do not determine which noun is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and which is the [[object (grammar)|object]]; rather, the affix of the verb determines this, though the ''ang''-marked noun is always the topic.

In addition to this, there are two verbal deictics, ''karí'', meaning come to speaker, and ''kadto'', meaning to go yonder.

===Copula===
Hiligaynon lacks the marker of sentence inversion "ay" of Tagalog/Filipino or "hay" of Akeanon.  Instead sentences in SV form (Filipino: ''Di karaniwang anyo'') are written without any marker or copula.

Examples:
	
"Si Maria ay maganda" (Tagalog)<br>
	
"Si Maria matahum/ Gwapa si Maria" (Hiligaynon) = "Maria is beautiful."
	
"Maria is beautiful" (English)

There is no direct translation for the English copula "to be" in Hiligaynon. However, the prefixes mangin- and nangin- may be used to mean will be and became, respectively.

Example:
	
Manamì mangín manggaránon.<br>
"It is nice to become rich."

The Spanish copula "estar" (to be) has also become a part of the Hiligaynon lexicon.  Its meaning and pronunciation have changed compared to its Spanish meaning, however.  In Hiligaynon it is pronounced as "istar" and means "to live (in)/location"(Compare with the Hiligaynon word "puyô").

Example:
	
Nagaistar ako sa tabuk suba<br>
"I live in tabuk suba"
"tabuk suba" translates to "other side of the river" and is also a barangay in Jaro, Iloilo.

===Existential===
To indicate the existence of an object, the word ''may'' is used.

Example:

{{Interlinear|May idô (a)ko|EXIST dog 1SG|I have a dog.}}

===Hiligaynon linkers===

When an adjective modifies a noun, the linker ''nga'' links the two.

Example:

Ido nga itom =
Black dog

Sometimes, if the linker is preceded by a word that ends in a vowel, glottal stop or the letter N, it becomes acceptable to contract it into -ng, as in Filipino.  This is often used to make the words sound more poetic or to reduce the number of syllables.  Sometimes the meaning may change as in ''maayo nga aga'' and ''maayong aga''.  The first meaning: (the) good morning; while the other is the greeting for 'good morning'.

The linker ''ka'' is used if a number modifies a noun.

Example:

Anum ka ido<br>
six dogs

===Interrogative words===
The interrogative words of Hiligaynon are as follows: ''diin'', ''san-o'', ''sin-o'', ''nga-a'', ''kamusta'', ''ano'', and ''pila''

''Diin'' means '''where'''.<br>
Example:<br>
Diin ka na subong?<br>
"Where are you now?"

A derivation of ''diin'', ''tagadiin'', is used to inquire the birthplace or hometown of the listener.<br>
Example:<br>
Tagadiin ka?<br>
"Where are you from?"

''San-o'' means '''when'''<br>
Example:<br>
San-o inâ?<br>
"When is that?"

''Sin-o'' means '''who'''<br>
Example:<br>
Sin-o imo abyan?<br>
"Who is your friend?"

''Nga-a'' means '''why'''<br>
Example:<br>
Nga-a indi ka magkadto?<br>
"Why won't you go?"

''Kamusta'' means '''how''', as in "How are you?"<br>
Example:<br>
Kamusta ang tindahan?<br>
"How is the store?"

''Ano'' means '''what'''<br>
Example:<br>
Ano ang imo ginabasa?<br>
"What are you reading?"

A derivative of ''ano'', paano, means '''how''', as in "How do I do that?"<br>
Example:<br>
Paano ko makapulî?<br>
"How can I get home?"

A derivative of ''paano'' is paanoano an archaic phrase which can be compared with kamusta <br>
Example:<br>
Paanoano ikaw?<br>
"How art thou?"

''Pila'' means '''how much/how many'''<br>
Example:<br>
Pila ang gaupod sa imo?<br>
"How many are with you?"

A derivative of ''pila'', ikapila, asks the numerical order of the person, as in, "What place were you born in your family?"(first-born, second-born, etc.) This word is notoriously difficult to translate into English, as English has no equivalent.<br>
Example:<br>
Ikapila ka sa inyo pamilya?<br>
"What place were you born into your family?"

A derivative of ''pila'', tagpila, asks the monetary value of something, as in, "How much is this beef?"<br>
Example:<br>
Tagpila ini nga karne sang baka?<br>
"How much is this beef?"

{{See also|Austronesian alignment}}

As it is essential for sentence structure and meaning, focus is a key concept in Hiligaynon and other Philippine languages. In English, in order to emphasize a part of a sentence, variation in intonation is usually employed – the voice is stronger or louder on the part emphasized. For example:

#'''The man''' is stealing rice from the market for his sister.
#The man is stealing '''rice''' from the market for his sister.
#The man is stealing rice from '''the market''' for his sister.
#The man is stealing rice from the market for '''his sister'''.

Furthermore, active and passive grammatical constructions can be used in English to place focus on the actor or object as the subject:

:''The man stole the rice.''  vs. ''The rice was stolen by the man.''

In contrast, sentence focus in Philippine languages is built into the construction by grammatical elements. Focus is marked by verbal affixes and a special particle prior to the noun in focus. Consider the following Hiligaynon translations of the above sentences:

#'''Naga'''kawat '''ang lalaki''' sang bugas sa tinda para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawat sang lalaki '''ang bugas''' sa tinda para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawatan sang lalaki sang bugas '''ang tinda''' para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawatan sang lalaki sang bugas sa tinda '''para sa iya utod'''.

:(''lalaki'' = man; ''kawat'' = to steal; ''bugas'' = rice; ''tinda'' = market; ''sibling'' = utod; ''kamot'' = hand)

===Reduplication===

Hiligaynon, like other Philippine languages, employs [[reduplication]], the repetition of a root or stem of a word or part of a word for grammatical or semantic purposes. Reduplication in Hiligaynon tends to be limited to roots instead of affixes, as the only inflectional or derivational morpheme that seems to reduplicate is <u>-pa-</u>. Root reduplication suggests 'non-perfectiveness' or 'non-telicity'. Used with [[noun]]s, reduplication of roots indicate particulars which are not fully actualized members of their class.<ref>{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 513|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|hdl = 1911/19215|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archive-date = 2011-10-05}}</ref> Note the following examples.

|balay-bálay
|house-house
|toy-house, playhouse}}

{{interlinear|number=(2)
|maestra-maestra
|teacher-teacher
|make-believe teacher}}

Reduplication of [[verb]]al roots suggests a process lacking a focus or decisive goal. The following examples describe events which have no apparent end, in the sense of lacking purpose or completion. A lack of seriousness may also be implied. Similarly, reduplication can suggest a background process in the midst of a foreground activity, as shown in (5).<ref>{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 514|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|hdl = 1911/19215|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archive-date = 2011-10-05}}</ref>

|NAG-IMP- eat-eat just 3PL.FOC UNFOC MAG-arrive FOC 3PL.UNFOC visitor
|They were just eating when their visitor arrived.}}

When used with [[adjective|adjectival]] roots, non-telicity may suggest a gradualness of the quality, such as the comparison in (6). In comparative constructions the final syllables of each occurrence of the reduplicated root are accented. If the stress of the second occurrence is shifted to the first syllable, then the reduplicated root suggests a superlative degree, as in (7). Note that superlatives can also be created through prefixation of <u>pinaka-</u> to the root, as in <u>pinaka-dakô</u>. While non-telicity can suggest augmentation, as shown in (7), it can also indicate diminishment as in shown in (9), in contrast with (8) (note the stress contrast). In (8b), <u>maàyoáyo</u>, accented in the superlative pattern, suggests a trajectory of improvement that has not been fully achieved. In (9b), <u>maàyoayó</u> suggests a trajectory of decline when accented in the comparative pattern. The reduplicated <u>áyo</u> implies sub-optimal situations in both cases; full goodness/wellness is not achieved.<ref>{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 514–515|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|hdl = 1911/19215|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archive-date = 2011-10-05}}</ref>

Consonants {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}} were once allophones but cannot interchange as in other Philippine languages: ''patawaron'' (to forgive) [from ''patawad'', forgiveness] but not ''patawadon,'' and ''tagadiín'' (from where) [from ''diín'', where] but not ''tagariín''.

===Vowels===

There are four main vowels: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i ~ ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/o ~ ʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (both spelled '''i''') are [[allophone]]s, with {{IPA|[i]}} in the beginning and middle and sometimes final syllables and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in final syllables. The vowels {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} are also allophones, with {{IPA|[ʊ]}} always being used when it is the beginning of a syllable, and {{IPA|[o]}} always used when it ends a syllable.

==Vocabulary==

===Derived from Spanish===
Hiligaynon has a large number of words derived from [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] including nouns (e.g., ''santo'' from ''santo'', "saint"), adjectives (e.g., ''berde'' from ''verde'', "green"), prepositions (e.g., ''antes'' from ''antes'', "before"), and conjunctions (e.g., ''pero'' from ''pero'', "but").

Nouns denoting material items and abstract concepts invented or introduced during [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|the early modern era]] include ''barko'' (''barco'', "ship"), ''sapatos'' (''zapatos'', "shoes"), ''kutsilyo'' (''cuchillo'', "knife"), ''kutsara'' (''cuchara'', "spoon"), ''tenedor'' ("fork"), ''plato'' ("plate"), ''kamiseta'' (''camiseta'', "shirt"), and ''kambiyo'' (''cambio'', "change", as in money). [[Spanish verbs]] are incorporated into Hiligaynon in their [[infinitive]] forms: ''edukar'', ''kantar'', ''mandar'', ''pasar''. The same holds true for other languages such as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. In contrast, incorporations of Spanish verbs into [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for the most part resemble, though are not necessarily derived from, the ''[[voseo|vos]]'' forms in the [[imperative mood|imperative]]: ''eduká'', ''kantá'', ''mandá'', ''pasá''. Notable exceptions include ''andar'', ''pasyal'' (from ''pasear'') and ''sugal'' (from ''jugar'').
