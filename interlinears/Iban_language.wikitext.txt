[[File:WIKITONGUES- Sedang speaking Iban.webm|thumb|An Iban speaker, recorded in [[Malaysia]].]]
The '''Iban language''' (''jaku Iban'') is spoken by the [[Iban people|Iban]], a branch of the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic group, who live in [[Brunei]], the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Kalimantan]] and in the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sarawak]]. It belongs to the [[Malayic languages]], a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].

==Classification==
{{expand section|date=April 2020}}
Iban is classified as a [[Malayic language]], a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. The language is closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]], more closely to [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian Malay]]. It is thought that the homeland of the Malayic languages is in western Borneo, where the Ibanic languages remain. The Malayan branch represents a secondary dispersal, probably from central [[Sumatra]] but possibly also from [[Borneo]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives |publisher=ANU Press |isbn=978-1-920942-85-4 |editor-last=Bellwood |editor-first=Peter |location=Canberra |language=en |doi=10.22459/a.09.2006 |editor-last2=Fox |editor-first2=James J. |editor-last3=Tryon |editor-first3=Darrell |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Background==
{{expand section|date=April 2020}}
The Iban language is the native language of the [[Iban people]], who fall under the general grouping of "[[Dayak people|Dayak]]"(i.e. native peoples of Borneo). Previously, the Iban were referred to during the colonial period as "Sea Dayaks". Their homeland is the island of [[Borneo]], which is politically divided between Malaysia and Indonesia; the Iban can mostly be found in the Malaysian state of Sarawak.

The language is mostly taught to students in rural areas with a majority Iban population, including [[Baleh, Sarawak|Baleh]] (Kapit), [[Betong Division|Betong]], [[Sri Aman]], [[Saratok]], [[Lubok Antu]], [[Pelagus]] (Kapit), [[Pakan, Sarawak|Pakan]] and [[Julau]]. In big cities liked Kuching, only a small number of school teaches Iban language. This is due to the limited amount of teacher who are capable of teaching Iban language. Form 5 and Form 3 students are allowed to take Iban language in their SPM & PT3 exam.

==Dialects==

The Iban can be subdivided into different sub-ethnic groups, each of which speak in different dialects. The most formal, intermediate, and working dialect is the Saribas dialect, and mainly Betong and Saratok. Others such as Balau, Sebuyau, Ulu Ai, and Rejang are mutually intelligible throughout the Sarawak region. The exception is the Iban [[Remun language|Remun/milikin]] dialect, which is still understood by Ibans from other districts. In West Kalimantan, dialects such as Bugau, Seberuang, Mualang, Chengkang, Sebaru, and Dau are more disparate.

==Writing system==
Although the Iban language is presently written using the [[Latin alphabet]], an Iban [[syllabary]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Iban |url=https://www.omniglot.com/writing/iban.htm |access-date=20 August 2019 |website=[[Omniglot]]}}</ref> (the [[Dunging script]]) was devised by Dunging anak Gunggu, who reportedly spent fifteen years from 1947 to 1962 devising the script.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Churchill Edward |date=20 June 2012 |title='Long Lost' Iban Alphabet Script 'Found' |work=[[The Borneo Post]] |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/06/20/long-lost-iban-alphabet-script-found/ |access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref> Twenty generations before Dunging, which would represent approximately 400–600 years, an ancestor named Renggi also devised a script, but it was apparently lost in a flood. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The Iban syllabary is published but is not widely distributed; recent efforts by Dr. Bromeley Philip of [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] to promote and revitalize the use of script have resulted in the creation of digital fonts, a teaching program, and the transcription of several traditional folktales.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2016-03-15 |title=Reviving the Iban alphabet |work=UiTM News Hub |url=https://news.uitm.edu.my/reviving-the-iban-alphabet/ |url-status=live |access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

In 2010, extending Dunging's work, Dr Bromeley Philip of Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Sarawak developed computer fonts for the Iban alphabet, called LaserIban. His aim is to help preserve the Iban alphabet in digital form in the modern world. The LaserIban is available for Windows and Macintosh computers and is completely cross-platform compatible.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Universiti Teknologi MARA |date=18 May 2015 |title=Reviving the Iban Alphabet |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-05-reviving-iban-alphabet.html |access-date=20 August 2019 |website=[[Phys.org]]}}</ref>

==Bible Translation==

===Genesis 1:1–3===
Ba pun iya kelia, lebuh Allah Taala berengkah ngaga langit enggau dunya, dunya endang apin bisi bakal tauka gamal sereta nadai utai nguan. Semina ribut ti deras ari Allah Taala aja ti bepuput atas tasik ti agi petang.  Allah Taala lalu bejaku, “Awakka penampak pegari.” Penampak lalu pegari. Allah Taala meda penampak nya manah; lalu Iya nyeraraka penampak nya ari pemetang. Iya ngumbai penampak nya “Siang” lalu pemetang nya dikumbai Iya “Malam.” Lemai ambis lalu pagi pen datai. Nya hari ti keterubah.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bup Kudus Baru |url=http://www.gerijaiban.com/bup_kudus.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022172244/http://www.gerijaiban.com/bup_kudus.php |archive-date=2018-10-22 |website=G-KRIS}}</ref>

====Translation====
In the beginning God created heaven and earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep water. The spirit of God was hovering over the water. Then God said, "Let there be light!" So there was light. God saw the light was good. So God separated the light from the darkness. God named the light "day", and the darkness he named "night". There was evening, then morning, the first day.
