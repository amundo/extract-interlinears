'''Tape''', also known as '''Maragus''', is a nearly extinct [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic language]] of [[Vanuatu]].<ref name="Ethnologue">{{Cite web |title=Maragus |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mrs |access-date=2019-10-07 |website=Ethnologue |language=en}}</ref> The population of speakers of the Tape language is reduced to approximately 15 speakers who are among the older generations.<ref name="Crowley 2006">{{Cite book |last=Crowley |first=Terry |title=Tape, a Declining Language of Malakula (Vanuatu) |date=2006 |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |isbn=0-85883-567-3 |editor-last=Lynch |editor-first=John |location=Canberra |language=en |doi=10.15144/PL-575 |hdl=1885/146275 |doi-access=free |hdl-access=free}}</ref> The language is part of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian Language family]].<ref name="Ethnologue" />

The Vanuatu Islands are not the original location of where the Tape language was spoken in the past. The original location was located in an area in [[Malakula]], including the coast from Anuatakh to Lowinsinwei, the area between the Lowisinwei River valley, the eastern bank of the Brenwei River, and a mountain in the south known as Pwitarvere. Since part of the Tape territory was close to the ocean, it allowed the people living in the area to harvest salt which was used to trade with the Tirakh people.<ref name="Crowley 2006" /> However, the Tape people mostly lived their lives "towards the bush," meaning their lives were more oriented towards the land even though they had access to the ocean. This is shown in their language because although they lived along the coast, their descendants were not very knowledgable or could not come up with a significant amount of terms related to the sea.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

Originally, there was no distinct name for the Tape language. Tape was the name of the area that the speakers lived on while in the past the language was referred to as vengesien Tape, meaning 'the language of Tape'. Over time however, people have come to use and recognize the name of the language to be "Tape". This language also has a few alternative names known as Marakus, Maragus, Maragaus, and Maraakhus, which were used by the speakers of the [[Litzlitz language|Naman language]] who were living in the Litzlitz area. The name has two roots, mar (person of (place)) and aakhus (bush) and when they are put together, the name's literal translation is 'person of the bush'.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

In the Tape language, there are a total of six vowels /a, e, i, o, u, and ə./ Although [[schwa]] (/ə/) is part of the list, there is a lot of debate on the role schwa plays in the language.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

Although [[schwa]] (/ə/) is a contrastive vowel among some languages, it is not a universal vowel in all the languages in the area. In the Tape language, schwa is very common and is in 16.5% of the lexicon. The schwa is a unique vowel because it cannot begin or end a word. It also cannot follow or come before another vowel, meaning that there must be simultaneously preceded and followed by a consonant.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

There are many similarities as well as differences in the consonants available in the languages around the Tape area. For example, Tape does not contain any [[Apicolabial consonant|apicolabial consonants]] which is similar to the languages in the northeastern part of Malakua. Also the Tape language includes the contrastive palatal affricate, /č/, which is not present in V'ënen Taut, a language located near Tape. In addition, the Tape language contains a contrastive series of [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar consonants]] which the languages, V'ënen Taut, Larevat, and Naman lack.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

== Grammar ==

===Nominalization===
One is able to obtain a noun by adding a ''-ien'' to the a verb root.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

Examples

* ''mekar'' meaning 'work'
* ''mekar-ien'' meaning 'work, job'
* ''mësit'' meaning 'sick'
* ''mësit-ien'' meaning 'illness, disease'
*''vërëng'' meaning 'think'
*''vërëng-ien'' meaning 'thought

By adding -ien to a verb ending in p, the p will usually change to a v.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

Examples

* ngep meaning 'breathe
* ngev-ien meaning 'asthma'

One is able to obtain a noun By adding në- to a verb.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

Examples

* jijër meaning 'sweep'
* në-jijër meaning 'broom'

===Compounding===
By combining two nouns together, one is able to form a new noun related to both words.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|lumlum tes
|waterweed sea
|'seaweed'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|netite dui
|child man
|'boy'}}

Adding a place after a noun indicates the noun is originating from that particular place.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|dui Tape
|man location
|'Tape man'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|dui elo
|man coast
|'coastal person'}}

=== Possession ===
In many Oceanic languages, there is a distinction between indirect and direct possession of nouns. Indirect possession usually occurs when adding another phrase or word after the possessive noun while direct possession occurs when adding a prefix to the noun it is possessing.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|nisip ese mwëliun
|knife POSS chief
|'the chief's knife'}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|pëti -k
|head 1SG|}}

==== Indirectly possessed nouns ====
There are special markers indicating the different types of possession like using ''ese-'' for general possession. Besides the general possession, there is possession towards, eating, chewing, and drinking. By adding ''de-, jomo-,'' and ''mëne-, one is'' referring to eating, chewing, and drinking respectively.

#ingelru ''dëmon isig''

When counting from 1-10, it is like counting in any other language where an arbitrary meaning is attached to a word. After counting to ten, one must add the word, ''isngel and dëmon before the'' numerals 1-9 to make teen numbers. The form, ''dëmon,'' has no meaning by itself in the Tape language.<ref name="Crowley 2006" />
