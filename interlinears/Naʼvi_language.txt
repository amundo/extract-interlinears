Oe-ri ontu teya l⟨äng⟩u
I-TOP nose full be⟨PEJ⟩
"My nose is full (of his distasteful smell)", lit "As for me, (my) nose is full"
: since the topic is "I", the subject "nose" is associated with "me": That is, it's understood to be "my nose". "Nose" itself is unmarked for case, as it's the subject of the intransitive verb "to be". However, in most cases the genitive marker -yä is used for this purpose.
