'''Jeju''' ({{lang-ko|제주어}} {{transl|ko|Jeju-eo}}, Korean and Jeju: {{lang|jje|제줏말}} {{transl|jje|Jejun-mal}} or {{lang|ko|제주말}} {{transl|jje|Jeju-mal}}{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=4}}), often called '''Jejueo'''<ref name=":0" /> or '''Jejuan'''<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Kim|first=Soung-u|date=2018|title=A multi-modal documentation of Jejuan conversations|url=https://elar.soas.ac.uk/Collection/MPI971100|website=Endangered Languages Archive at SOAS University of London}}</ref> in English-language scholarship, is a [[Koreanic language]] traditionally spoken on [[Jeju Island]], [[South Korea]]. While often classified as a divergent '''Jeju dialect''' ({{lang-ko|제주방언}} {{transl|ko|Jeju bang'eon}}) of the Korean language, the [[language variety|variety]] is referred to as a language in local government and increasingly in both South Korean and foreign academia. Jeju is not [[mutually intelligible]] with the mainland dialects of South Korea.

The consonants of Jeju are similar to those of Seoul Korean, but Jeju has a larger and more conservative vowel inventory. Jeju is a [[head-final]], [[agglutinative]], suffixing language like Korean. Nouns are followed by [[particle (linguistics)|particles]] that may function as [[case marker]]s. Verbs [[inflect]] for [[tense-aspect-mood|tense, aspect, mood]], [[evidentiality]], relative social status, formality, and other grammatical information. Korean and Jeju differ significantly in their verbal paradigms. For instance, the [[continuative aspect]] marker of Jeju{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=11}} and the [[grammatical mood|mood]] or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] distinction of many Jeju connective suffixes are absent in Korean. While most of the Jeju lexicon is Koreanic, the language preserves many [[Middle Korean]] words now lost in Standard Korean. Jeju may also have a [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] substratum (see [[Peninsular Japonic]]).{{sfnp|Vovin|2010|p=24}}

Jeju was already divergent from [[Seoul]] Korean by the fifteenth century, and was unintelligible to mainland Korean visitors by the sixteenth century. The language was severely undermined by the [[Jeju uprising]] of 1948, the [[Korean War]], and the [[Miracle on the Han River|modernization of South Korea]]. All fluent speakers remaining in Jeju Island are now over seventy years old. Most people in Jeju Island now speak a variety of Korean with a Jeju [[substratum (linguistics)|substratum]]. The language may be somewhat more vigorous in a diaspora community in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]], but even there, younger members of the community speak Japanese. Since 2010, [[UNESCO]] has designated the language as [[endangered language|critically endangered]], the highest level of language endangerment possible. [[Language revitalization|Revitalization]] efforts are ongoing.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=280–281}}

== Nomenclature and relationship to Korean ==

[[File:Jeju language vs. Jeju dialect in South Korean academic publications.png|423x255px|thumb]]

Jeju is closely related to Korean. It was traditionally considered an unusually divergent [[dialect]] of Korean, and is still referred to as such by the [[National Institute of the Korean Language]] and the [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|South Korean Ministry of Education]].{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=5}} While the term "Jeju language" ({{lang-ko|제주어}}, {{transl|ko|Jeju-eo}}) was first used in 1947, it was not until the mid-1990s that the term gained currency in South Korean academia. While "Jeju dialect" was still the preferred usage throughout the decade of the 2000s, the majority of South Korean academic publications had switched to the term "Jeju language" by the early 2010s.{{sfn|Cho T.-r.|2014|pp=123–126}} Since somewhat earlier, "Jeju language" has also been the term preferred in local law, such as the 2007 Language Act for the Preservation and Promotion of the Jeju Language ({{lang-ko|제주어 보전 및 육성 조례}} {{transl|ko|Jeju-eo bojeon mit yukseong jorye}}), and by non-governmental organizations working to preserve the language.{{sfn|Cho T.-r.|2014|pp=129–130}} The only English-language monograph on Jeju, published in 2019, consistently refers to it as a language as well.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019}} Among native speakers, the term ''Jeju-mal'' "Jeju speech" is most common.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=4}}

Jeju is not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with even the southernmost dialects of mainland Modern Korean. In a 2014 test for intelligibility, Korean speakers from three different dialect zones (Seoul, [[Busan]], and [[Yeosu]]) were exposed to one minute of spoken Jeju, with a [[control group]] of native Jeju speakers. On average, Korean native speakers from all three dialect zones answered less than 10% of the basic comprehension questions correctly, while native Jeju speakers answered over 89% of the questions correctly. These results are comparable to the results of an intelligibility test of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for native [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers.{{sfn|Yang C.|O'Grady|Yang S.|Hilton|2019}} Diaspora Jeju speakers living in Japan also report that they find it difficult to understand South Korean news media, and resort to Japanese subtitles when watching South Korean TV shows.{{sfn|Kim B.|2014|p=120}}

== Geographic distribution ==

Jeju was traditionally spoken throughout [[Jeju Province]] except in the [[Chuja Islands]], halfway between Jeju Island and mainland Korea, where a variety of [[Jeolla dialect|Southwestern Korean]] is found.{{sfn|Choi M.|1998|p=16}} The language is also used by some of the [[immigrant generation|first- and second-generation]]{{efn|The term "first and second generations" as used here refers to Jeju speakers born in Jeju, though now living in Japan (the first generation), and to their children who were born in Japan (the second generation).}} members of the [[Zainichi Korean]] community in [[Ikuno-ku, Osaka|Ikuno-ku]], [[Osaka]], Japan.{{sfn|Kim B.|2014}}

Compared to mainland Korean dialect groups, there is little internal variation within Jeju. A distinction between a northern and southern dialect with a geographic divide at [[Hallasan]] is sometimes posited, but an eastern-western dialectal divide cutting through [[Jeju City]] and [[Seogwipo]] may better explain the few dialectal differences that do exist.{{sfn|Choi M.|1998|p=25}}{{sfn|Ko J.|Song S.|Kim Jee-h.|Oh C.|2014|p=214}} A 2010 survey of regional variation in 305 word sets suggests that the north–south divide and the east–west divide coexist, resulting in four distinct dialect groups.{{sfn|Kim S.|2010}}

== History and decline ==

The Koreanic languages are likely not native to Jeju Island; it has been proposed that the family has its roots in Manchuria, a historical region in northeastern Asia. It is thought that Koreanic speakers migrated from southern Manchuria between the third and eighth centuries CE. Linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] suggests that the ancient kingdom of [[Tamna]], which ruled the island until the twelfth century, may have spoken a [[Peninsular Japonic|Japonic]] language that left a [[substratum|substrate]] influence on Jeju. When exactly this putative Japonic language may have been replaced by the Koreanic ancestor of Jeju remains unclear.{{sfn|Vovin|2013|pp=236–237}}

Unlike mainland Korea, which was [[Goryeo under Mongol rule|ruled only indirectly by the Mongols]], Jeju was placed under direct [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] administration in the late thirteenth century. Significant numbers of Mongol soldiers migrated to the island during this period, and [[Middle Mongol|their language]] acted as a [[superstratum]] that may have accelerated local language change. Linguist Yang Changyong speculates that the formation of Jeju as a language independent of Korean was influenced by Mongol.{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=1–2}} By the fifteenth century, when the invention of [[Hangul]] permits a detailed understanding of Korean phonology for the first time, Seoul Korean and Jeju were already divergent; the Seoul [[prestige dialect]] of fifteenth-century Middle Korean disallowed the diphthong {{IPA|/jʌ/}}, but Jeju does not.{{sfn|Lee K.|Ramsey|2011|pp=159–160}}

Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century references to the language of Jeju by mainland Korean literati state that it was already unintelligible to mainland Koreans.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=6}} [[Kim Sang-heon]] (1570―1652), who served as pacification commissioner ({{lang-ko|안무어사}} {{transl|ko|anmueosa}}) on the island from 1601 to 1602, gives six words in the "provincial language" with clear cognates in modern Jeju and also writes:{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=2–4}}

<blockquote>
{{lang|lzh|謫人 申長齡 乃譯官也 嘗曰 「比島語音 酷以中華 如驅牛馬之聲 尤不可分辯云云 盖風氣與華不隔而然耶 曾爲元朝所據置官於此故與華相雜而然耶」... 所謂俚語者 但高細不可曉}}

"The exiled man Shin Jangnyeong was originally a [[Bureau of Interpreters#Interpreters|government interpreter]]. He said, 'The language of this island is most like Chinese, and the sounds they make while driving cattle and horses are yet more impossible to tell apart. Is this because the climate is not far from that of China, or because the Yuan dynasty once ruled and appointed officials here and the Chinese mingled with them?'... What is called the provincial language is but high and thin and cannot be understood."
</blockquote>

In 1629, the Korean government banned the emigration of Jeju Islanders to the mainland, further restricting linguistic contacts between Jeju and Korean.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=3}} At the same time, the island was also used throughout the [[Joseon]] era (1392―1910) as a place of exile for disgraced [[scholar-officials]]. These highly educated speakers of Seoul Korean often tutored the children of their Jeju neighbors during their exile and established a continuous and significant Seoul Korean superstratum in Jeju.{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=2–4}}

Jeju remained the dominant language of both private and public spheres under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]] (1910―1945), although many Japanese loanwords entered the lexicon, and many speakers were [[monolingual]].{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=4–5}} Large-scale migration of Jeju people to Japan began in 1911, and 38,000 Jeju Islanders lived in [[Osaka]] alone by 1934. Immigration to Japan continued even after Korean independence into the 1980s. Jeju is still spoken by older members of these diaspora communities, although younger individuals speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as their native language and are not fluent in Jeju.{{sfn|Kim B.|2014|pp=113–127}}

[[File:Jeju Massacre.jpg|thumb|Jeju inhabitants awaiting execution in late 1948]]

Severe disruption to the Jeju language community began after the end of Japanese rule in 1945. Following World War II, Korea was divided between an American-backed government in the South and a Soviet-backed government in the North.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|date=2019-05-28|title=Memories of Massacres Were Long Suppressed Here.

The [[Syngman Rhee]] regime, which succeeded the American administration in August 1948, suppressed the rebellion with mass killings of civilians. As many as sixty thousand Jeju Islanders, or a full fifth of the pre-rebellion population, were killed. Forty thousand more fled to Japan. Out of the four hundred villages of the island, only 170 remained.{{sfn|Cummings|2005|pp=219–221}} The devastating impact of the massacres on the Jeju language community was exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950. While Jeju was never occupied by the North Korean army, nearly 150,000 Korean-speaking refugees from the mainland fleeing North Korean invasion arrived in Jeju in the first year of the war. These events shattered the Jeju language's former dominance on the island,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=12}} and Standard Korean was beginning to displace Jeju in the public sphere by the 1950s.{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=5–7}}

The decline of Jeju continued into the 1960s and 1970s. The [[Saemaeul Movement]], an ambitious rural modernization program launched by [[Park Chung-hee]], disrupted the traditional village community where Jeju had thrived. The language came to be perceived as an incorrect dialect of Korean, so that students were subject to corporal punishment if they used it in school,{{sfn|Brenzinger|Yang C.|2017}} and the use of Standard Korean even in the private sphere began to spread from Jeju City outwards.{{sfn|Yang C.|2014|pp=7–8}} The [[language ideology|language attitude]] of native Jeju speakers in this period was self-disparaging, and even Jeju people regarded the use of Jeju "with contempt."{{sfn|Brenzinger|Yang C.|2017}} A 1981 survey of language attitudes among high school and university students natively speaking Seoul Korean, [[Chungcheong dialect|Chungcheong Korean]], [[Jeolla dialect|Southwestern Korean]], [[Gyeongsang dialect|Southeastern Korean]], and Jeju showed that Jeju speakers were the most likely among the five groups to ascribe negative traits to their native variety.{{sfn|Lee J.|1981|pp=569–573}}

A 1992 study of [[code-switching]] by native Jeju speakers shows that Jeju was by then in an unfavorable [[diglossic]] relationship with Korean, and was largely restricted to informal contexts even between Jeju natives.{{sfn|Kang Y.-h.|1994|pp=90–117}} Within a primarily Jeju-language conversation, speakers might spontaneously switch to Korean to emphasize the rationality or truth value of their statement, while switching to Jeju in a primarily Korean conversation signified that the speaker was making a subjective statement or being less serious.{{sfn|Kang Y.-h.|1994|pp=117–139}}

The same study notes that by 1992, even this variety restricted to the informal domain was usually a Korean dialect with a Jeju substratum, rather than the traditional Jeju language:

<blockquote>
{{lang|ko|현재 상용되는 제주말의 경우, 표준말과의 차이가 과거에 비해 크게 줄어들고 있는 상황으로써 특히 어미활용에서 표준말과의 차이가 극대화되며, 다른 부분에서는 상대적으로 표준말과의 차이가 극소화된다는 점이다. 따라서 제주사람들은 과거 사용되던 토박이 말에 가까운 것은 '진한 (심한) 제주말'로, 현재 사용되는 제주말은 '옅은 제주말' 또는 '(표준어와) 섞어진 말'로 표현하는 등, 제주말과 표준말이 일종의 방언 연속체를 형성하는 것으로 인식하고 있다.}}{{sfn|Kang Y.-h.|1994|pp=87–88}}

"As for the Jeju language [{{lit|Jeju speech}}] in general use nowadays [as of 1992], the situation is that its differences from Standard Korean are greatly diminishing compared to the past. Its greatest differences with Standard Korean [now] lie especially in the suffix paradigm, and in other areas the differences are being minimized. The Jeju people accordingly understand that Jeju and Standard Korean are in a form of [[dialect continuum]], and refer to the native language formerly in use as "thick (or intense) Jeju language" and the Jeju language currently in use as "light Jeju language" or "mixed (with Korean) language."
</blockquote>

== Current status ==

The official language of South Korea is Standard Korean. Nearly all residents of Jeju Island are bilingual in Standard Korean and Jeju, while many younger individuals are even more fluent in English than in Jeju. Standard Korean is most commonly used in the majority of public areas, while Jeju tends to be reserved for use at home and a few local markets.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Shields|first=Steven|date=2019-12-31|title=Studying Jeju Island's endangered language|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/12/177_280951.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=koreatimes|language=en}}</ref> All schools located on Jeju Island are required to teach Standard Korean and only offer Jeju as a non-mandatory extracurricular activity.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Yang|first=Sejung|date=2017-03-22|title=Teaching Jejueo on Jeju Island 제주어 교육 - Jejueo|url=https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/jejueo/jejueo-revitalization/teaching-jejueo|access-date=2020-12-01|website=sites.google.com}}</ref> As a result, there are currently no monolingual speakers of Jeju.

As of 2018, fluent speakers in Jeju Island were all over seventy years of age, while [[passive speaker (language)|passive competence]] was found in some people in their forties and fifties. Younger Islanders speak Korean with Jeju substrate influence{{sfn|Brenzinger|Yang C.|2017}} found in residual elements of the Jeju verbal paradigm and in select vocabulary such as kinship terms.{{sfn|Saltzman|2014|pp=25–26}} The language is more vigorous in Osaka, where there may be fluent speakers born as late as the 1960s.<ref>"In Osaka... some fluent speakers are as young as 45" (p.9). {{harvnb|Saltzman|2014|pp=1–2, 9, 32–33, 39–40, 43–44, 53–54, 58–59, 67}}</ref> Since 2010,{{sfn|UNESCO|2010}} [[UNESCO]] has classified Jeju as a critically [[endangered language]], defined as one whose "youngest speakers are grandparents and older... [who] speak the language partially and infrequently."{{sfn|UNESCO|2017}}

A 2008 survey of adult residents' knowledge of ninety Jeju cultural words showed that only twenty-one were understood by the majority of those surveyed.{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2008|pp=16–18}} Lack of [[heritage language|heritage knowledge]] of Jeju is even more severe among younger people. Four hundred Jeju teenagers were surveyed for their knowledge of 120 basic Jeju vocabulary items in 2010, but only nineteen words were recognized by the majority while forty-five words were understood by less than 10%.{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2010}} A 2018 study suggests that even the verbal paradigm, among the more resilient parts of the substratum, may be in danger; the average middle schooler was more competent in the verb system of English, a language "taught only a few hours a week in school and in private tutoring institutions," than of Jeju.{{sfn|Yang S.|2018|pp=111–113}}

[[Language revitalization|Revitalization efforts]] have recently been ongoing. On September 27, 2007, the [[Jeju Province|Jeju provincial]] government promulgated the Language Act for the Preservation and Promotion of the Jeju Language,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=278}} which established five-year plans for state-backed language preservation.The Act encouraged public schools on Jeju Island to offer Jeju as an extracurricular activity, as well as to incorporate the language as a part of regular classes if relevant and feasible.<ref name=":3" /> In addition, multiple programs were provided for adults, as well. For example, adult language programs are offered every year at the Jeju National University and are all completely free of charge. There are also several local centres on Jeju Island that offer classes in Jeju Language specifically to marriage-based immigrants.<ref name=":3" /> However, it was not until UNESCO's 2010 designation of Jeju as critically endangered that the provincial government became proactive in Jeju preservation efforts.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|pp=492–493}} In 2016, the provincial government allotted [[South Korean won|₩]]685,000,000 (US$565,592 in 2016) to revitalization programs,{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019b|pp=312–313}} and the government-funded [[Jeju Research Institute]] has compiled phrasebooks of the language.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|pp=504–505}} The provincial Ministry of Education has also published Jeju textbooks for elementary and secondary schools, although some textbooks really teach Standard Korean interspersed with Jeju lexical items. Some public schools offer after-school programs for Jeju, but the short duration of these classes may be insufficient to promote more than "symbolic" use by students.{{sfn|Brenzinger|Yang C.|2017|p=192}} The linguistic competence of many teachers has also been challenged.{{sfn|Yang S.|2014|pp=7–8}}

On August 12, 2011, the Research Centre for Jeju Studies was opened with the purpose of implementing projects for the revitalization and safeguarding of Jeju Language.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Concerted efforts for the revitalization of Jeju language {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/dynamic-content-single-view-meeting/news/concerted_efforts_for_the_revitalization_of_jeju_language/|access-date=2020-12-01|website=www.unesco.org}}</ref> The centre has implemented multiple projects and initiatives. The project encouraged the promotion of Jeju Language in schools by tasking the Education Bureau with introducing several revitalization initiatives, including a training program for teachers. The project also started a radio broadcast in Jeju Language, as well as a radio campaign for Jeju slang and an annual Jeju Language festival.<ref name=":4" /> An iPhone application was developed, including a glossary, as well as a collection of proverbs, poems, and quizzes in Jeju Language. Finally, an introductory conversation brochure was distributed to both citizens and visitors of Jeju Island in order to encourage the use of the language.<ref name=":4" />

Other preservation and revitalization efforts are led by non-state bodies. The Jeju Language Preservation Society ({{lang-ko|제주어보존회}} {{transl|ko|Jeju-eo bojon-hoe}}), founded in December 2008, publishes ''Deongdeureong-makke'' ({{lang|jje|덩드렁마께}}), a bimonthly Jeju-language magazine, and holds Jeju teaching programs and speaking contests.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|pp=505–506}} Literature in the language has recently been published, including children's books and a 2014 poetry anthology. Local bands and theater troupes have made Jeju-language performances.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|pp=508–510}} Regional newspapers such as the ''Jemin Ilbo'' and the ''Halla Ilbo'' include Jeju-language sections, and local branches of [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] have launched radio programs and a television series in Jeju.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019b|pp=507–508}} Recent South Korean media with nationwide appeal, including the 2010 television series ''[[Life Is Beautiful (2010 TV series)|Life is Beautiful]]'' and ''[[The Great Merchant]]'', the 2012 drama film ''[[Jiseul]]'', and the 2015 television series ''[[Warm and Cozy]]'', have also featured spoken Jeju.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|pp=508–510}} Outside of Korea, in 2018, the [[Endangered Languages Archive]] at [[SOAS University of London]] carried out a revitalization project aimed to build a collection of audio and video recordings of Jeju Language being spoken by native speakers. These recordings documented everyday conversations, as well as traditional songs and rituals.<ref name=":1" />

In the past, negative attitudes and opinions towards Jeju were popular amongst Korean citizens. The Standard Korean language places a lot of emphasis on honorifics, as Korean culture is largely centred around being polite to elders. However, Jeju is often viewed to be less polite, due to the use of less honorifics and only four levels of politeness, in comparison to the seven levels in Standard Korean.<ref name=":2" /> The younger generation, particularly students, especially believe that Jeju is not respectful enough to use with teachers, whereas Standard Korean is more sophisticated. In addition, Jeju is often associated with the countryside, as the majority of speakers tend to have traditional occupations, including farming, fishing, and diving.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-10-14|title=Distinct dialect of Jeju threatened with extinction|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/12/113_96644.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=koreatimes|language=en}}</ref> As a result, many younger children express a disinterest in learning the language.

However, recent surveys show changes favorable towards Jeju in prevailing language attitudes. In a [[National Institute of the Korean Language]] survey in 2005, only 9.4% of Jeju Islanders were very proud of the regional variety. When the same survey was reheld in 2015, 36.8% were very proud of the language,{{sfn|Kwak|You|2019|p=44}} and Jeju Islanders had become the most likely among South Korean dialect groups to have "very positive" opinions of the regional variety.{{sfn|NIKL|2015|p=98}} In a 2017 study of 240 Jeju Islanders, 82.8% of those sampled considered Jeju to be "nice to listen to,"<ref>{{lang|ko|듣기 좋다}} {{transl|ko|deutgi jota}}. {{harvnb|Kim S.|2019|pp=10–11}}</ref> and 74.9% hoped that their children would learn the language.{{sfn|Kim S.|2019|p=23}} But significant generational cleavages in language attitudes were also found. For instance, only 13.8% of Jeju Islanders between twenty and forty liked Jeju much more than Standard Korean, which 49.1% of those above eighty did.{{sfn|Kim S.|2019|pp=21–22}}

In a 2013 survey of Jeju natives, 77.9% agreed with the statement that "[the Jeju language] has to be passed down as part of Jeju culture."{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=278–289}} But a 2015 study of approximately a thousand Jeju Islanders suggests that even though most Jeju Islanders believe the language to be an important part of the island's culture, the vast majority are skeptical of the language's long-term viability, and more people are unwilling than willing to actively participate in language preservation efforts.{{sfn|Yang C.|2016|pp=152–154}}

Jeju has historically had no [[written language]].{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=22–23}} Two recently devised standard [[orthography|orthographies]] are currently in use: a system created in 1991 by scholars of the Jeju Dialect Research Society ({{lang-ko|제주방언연구회}} {{transl|ko|Jeju bang'eon yeon'gu-hoe}}), and a system promulgated by the provincial government in 2014.{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2018|pp=12–14}} Both systems use the Korean alphabet [[Hangul]] with one additional letter {{lang|jje|ㆍ}}, which was used in the [[Middle Korean|Middle]] and [[Early Modern Korean]] scripts but is now defunct in written Korean. Similar to the modern Korean script, Jeju orthographies have [[morphophonemic]] tendencies, meaning that transcribing the underlying [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] generally takes precedence over the [[surface form]].{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=22–23}} The two orthographies differ largely because they are based on different morphological analyses of the language, especially of the verbal paradigm, as seen in the example below.{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2018|pp=19–27}}

This article will use the government's orthography where the two differ.

The [[transliteration]] scheme generally used in Korean linguistics, including when transcribing Jeju, is the [[Yale Romanization of Korean|Yale Romanization system]]. Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019 instead uses a variant of the [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]] system with the addition of the sequence ''aw'' for {{lang|jje|ㆍ}} {{IPA|/ɒ/}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=15, 18}} This article also uses Revised Romanization with the addition of ''aw'', but without Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's one-to-one correspondence between Hangul glyphs and the Latin alphabet.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===

The non-approximant consonants of Jeju correspond to the [[Korean phonology#Consonants|nineteen non-approximant consonants of Standard Korean]], and Jeju displays the three-way contrast between [[plosive|stops]] and [[affricates]] characteristic of Modern Korean. Whether the [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, absent in Standard Korean, exists as a [[phoneme]] in Jeju or merely as an allophone of {{IPA|/h/}} remains disputed.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=16–18}} A 2000 acoustic and aerodynamic study of eight native Jeju speakers concludes that "the consonants of the two languages seem to be the same in every respect... the phonetic realization of all [Jeju] consonants are the same as those found in [Seoul] Korean."{{sfn|Cho T.-h.|Jun|Ladefoged|2000|p=137}}

==== Consonantal phonological processes ====

Jeju [[allophony]] involves a number of [[phonological process]]es also found in Seoul Korean. As in Korean, {{IPA|/l/}} surfaces as {{IPA|[ɾ]}} intervocally. Also as in Korean, lax stops and affricates have fully voiced allophones in medial position, all [[obstruents]] have [[no audible release|unreleased]] allophones in final position, and syllable-final sibilants surface as {{IPA|[t̚]}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=17, 24–25}} Whether non-lax stops and affricates{{efn|Other than {{IPA|/p͈/}}{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=23}}}} can appear in final position is controversial. The morphological analysis necessary for the government's orthography permits them, while the analysis behind the Jeju Language Research Society's orthography forbids them.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=23}}{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2018|pp=23–25}}

Most [[Korean phonology#Consonant assimilation|non-morphophonological consonant assimilation rules of Standard Korean]] are also found in Jeju. {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/s͈/}} are regularly [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}. Lax obstruents are tensed following another obstruent. {{IPA|/h/}} aspirates both the preceding and the subsequent lax obstruent. A nasal consonant nasalizes a preceding obstruent{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=25–27}} or {{IPA|/h/}}. {{IPA|/l/}} becomes {{IPA|[n]}} following all consonants except itself or {{IPA|/n/}}, and this {{IPA|[n]}} can itself nasalize the preceding obstruent so that the underlying sequence {{IPA|/pl/}} is realized as {{IPA|[mn]}}. On the other hand, underlying {{IPA|/ln/}} and {{IPA|/nl/}} both produce {{IPA|[ll]}}.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=62–66}}

Jeju also has consonant allophones that appear only at [[morpheme]] boundaries. Some of these are found in Standard Korean, such as the insertion of {{IPA|[n]}} before {{IPA|i-}} or {{IPA|j-}} at most word-internal morpheme boundaries; the palatalization of {{IPA|/t/}} to {{IPA|[dʑ]}} before an affixal {{IPA|-i}}; and the tensing of obstruents following certain morpheme-final nasals. Other rules are absent in Standard Korean. For instance, a [[sonorant]]-final word or morpheme can trigger aspiration (for older speakers) or tensing (for younger speakers) in a subsequent lax consonant. In some cases this is due to [[#Underlying consonant clusters|an underlying consonant cluster]], but not all cases can be explained in this way. Other Jeju-specific processes include the doubling of a word-final consonant when followed by a vowel,  glide, or {{IPA|/h/}}, and the [[lenition]] of {{IPA|/p/}} to {{IPA|[w]}} at some word boundaries.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=27–31, 36}}

Verbal conjugation can also lead to consonantal changes. Verb stem-final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} are lost before {{IPA|/n/}}. In the case of verb stems ending in {{IPA|-d}}, {{IPA|-p}}. {{IPA|-s}}, and {{IPA|-k}}, the final consonants are always preserved in so-called regular verbs, but in irregular verbs, {{IPA|-d}} and {{IPA|-p}} are [[lenition|lenited]] to {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|[u~w]}} respectively while {{IPA|-s}} and {{IPA|-k}} are lost when followed by a vowel.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=170–179, 182–189}}

==== Underlying consonant clusters ====

While not permitted in the surface representation of Jeju, morpheme-final [[consonant clusters]] can exist in the underlying form. Many cases of post-sonorant aspiration involve morphemes whose [[Middle Korean]] cognates feature a final {{IPA|-h}}, suggesting that an underlying final {{IPA|-h}} after the sonorant should be posited in Jeju as well.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=29–30}} Besides these {{IPA|h}}-final clusters, Jeju permits a number of other final consonant clusters, including {{IPA|-lk}}, {{IPA|-lm}}, {{IPA|-mk~ŋk}}, {{IPA|-sk}},{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=23}} and (in the analysis of the government's orthography) {{IPA|-ms}}.{{sfn|Kang Y.-b.|2018|pp=25–27}} These clusters surface as a single consonant in isolation or before a consonant, but are fully realized when followed by a vowel.

The phonemic identity of {{lang|jje|ㆍ}} is controversial,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=18–19}} but native speakers most commonly realize the phoneme as {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.{{sfn|Kim W.|2004}}{{sfn|Moon S.|Oh C.|Kim W.|Shin W.|2015|pp=65–66}} {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are only distinguished in the initial syllable.{{sfn|Moon S.|Oh C.|Kim W.|Shin W.|2015|pp=66–69}}

Among younger and less fluent speakers, {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}} have both [[raising (phonetics)|raised]] to {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}{{efn|{{IPA|/ɒ/}} merges with {{IPA|/o/}} in the initial syllable and with {{IPA|/ə/}} in non-initial ones. An apparent fronting of {{IPA|/ɒ/}} to {{IPA|/a/}}, seen in heritage speakers born in the 1980s, is not a genuine Jeju development but simply interference from Standard Korean, where {{IPA|/a/}} is cognate to Jeju {{IPA|/ɒ/}}.{{sfn|Ko D.|2008}}}} respectively, resulting in a seven-vowel system identical to the vowel inventory of Seoul Korean.{{sfn|Ko D.|2008}}{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=19–20}} The raising of Jeju {{IPA|/æ/}} occurred before the raising of {{IPA|/ɒ/}},{{sfn|Ko D.|2008|p=65}} and may have predated Standard Korean's ongoing merger of {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}. The subsequent loss of {{IPA|/ɒ/}} may have been motivated by a language-internal desire for symmetry in the vowel system.{{sfn|Cho T.-h.|Jun|Jung|Ladefoged|2000|p=10}} On the other hand, the vowel mergers are accelerated among Jeju speakers living in coastal communities more exposed to Standard Korean.{{sfn|Shin W.|Shin J.|2012|pp=83–87}}

Jeju has two or three [[semivowel|glides]]: {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, and possibly {{IPA|/ɰ/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} can occur with all vowels except {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. {{IPA|/jæ/}} and {{IPA|/je/}} have merged even among speakers who distinguish the [[monophthong]]s,{{sfn|Moon S.|Oh C.|Kim W.|Shin W.|2015|pp=82–83}} and many speakers who retain {{IPA|/ɒ/}} also merge {{IPA|/jɒ/}} with {{IPA|/jə/}}.{{sfn|Moon S.|Oh C.|Kim W.|Shin W.|2015|pp=80, 90}} {{IPA|/w/}} cannot occur with the three back vowels or with {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. {{IPA|/ɰ/}} occurs only with {{IPA|/i/}}, and the resulting diphthong {{IPA|/ɰi/}} is generally realized as {{IPA|[ɨ]}} word-initially and {{IPA|[i]}} otherwise.{{sfn|Kim W.|2005}}

Glide-vowel sequences may be analyzed as [[diphthongs]], with the phonemic identities of {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[w]}}, and {{IPA|[ɰ]}} being {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o~u/}}, and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} respectively.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=49}}

==== Vowel phonological processes ====

Several phonological processes affect the surface realization of Jeju vowels. In one process shared with Standard Korean, a bisyllabic vowel sequence may be contracted to a monosyllabic polyphthong.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=28}}{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=96–97}}

|-
| "cucumber" || {{lang|jje|오이}} {{transl|jje|'''oi'''}} || {{lang|jje|웨}} {{transl|jje|'''we'''}}
|}

Vowel-affecting processes are particularly numerous in the verbal paradigm. Verb stem-final {{transl|jje|-eu}} is lost before a vowel-initial suffix.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=106–108}} Similar to Standard Korean, a stem-final {{IPA|-i}} diphthongizes a subsequent vowel by inserting the [[onglide]] {{IPA|[j]}}. Unlike in its sister language, Jeju {{IPA|j-}}insertion may occur even with an intervening consonant,{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=94–95}} and between a verb stem ending in {{transl|jje|-e}}, {{transl|jje|-ae}}, or {{transl|jje|-aw}} and a suffix with initial {{transl|jje|eo-}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=34}}

Many of Jeju's consonant-initial verbal suffixes take an initial [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel if the previous morpheme ends with a consonant.{{efn|Excluding the liquid consonant {{IPA|/l/}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|p=33}}}} The default epenthetic vowel is {{lang|jje|-으-}} {{transl|jje|-eu-}} {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, but the vowel surfaces as {{lang|jje|-이-}} {{transl|jje|-i-}} {{IPA|[i]}} following a sibilant and as {{lang|jje|-우-}} {{transl|jje|-u-}} {{IPA|[u]}} following an underlying labial.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=35–36}}

Like Standard Korean but unlike Middle Korean, [[Korean phonology#Vowel harmony|Koreanic vowel harmony]] is no longer generally applicable in all native morphemes{{sfn|Ko D.|1997|pp=10–15, 22–27}} but remains productive in [[sound symbolism]] and certain verbal suffixes. Jeju has two harmonic classes, [[yin and yang]]. The neutral vowel {{IPA|/i/}} can occur with either class.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=49}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-

For instance, the [[perfective aspect]] marker {{lang|jje|-엇}} {{transl|jje|-eos}} takes the vowel harmonic [[allomorph]] {{lang|jje|-앗}} {{transl|jje|-as}} after verb stems whose (final) vowel is yang:{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=32}}

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| colspan="2" | <div class="center"> {{lang|jje|싯엇어}} {{transl|jje|s'''i'''s-'''eo'''s-eo}} "washed" </div>
|}

In certain cases, suffix allomorphs do not match the harmonic class of the previous vowel. Verb stems with final vowel {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/ɨ/}} take the yang allomorph if their Middle Korean forms were {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, thus conserving their original harmonic class while violating their current one. Disyllabic stems that end in {{IPA|-u}} also take the yang allomorph, but monosyllabic {{IPA|-u}} stems or disyllabic {{IPA|-uC}} stems do not.{{sfn|Ko D.|1997|pp=42–43}}

=== Phonotactics ===

Jeju syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C) with G being a glide.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=21}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|}

As in Standard Korean, {{transl|jje|ng-}} {{IPA|/ŋ/}} cannot occur syllable-initially, and {{transl|jje|l-}} {{IPA|/l/}} does not occur word-initially in native words.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=17–18}}

=== Prosody ===

Jeju does not have phonemic [[vowel length]], [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], or [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Its [[phonological hierarchy]] is characterized by accentual phrases similar to those of Standard Korean, with a basic Low-High-Low-High tonal pattern varying according to [[sentence type]], but there are also important differences in the two languages' prosody.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=21–22}} Jeju has a weaker tonal distinction within the first half of the accentual phrase than Seoul Korean does, while its aspirate consonants do not produce as significant a high pitch as their Seoul equivalents.{{sfn|Lee S.|2014}} Jeju uses more [[tone contour|contour tones]], where the pitch shifts within a single syllable, than Seoul Korean.{{sfn|Shin W.|2015}} Unlike in Seoul Korean,  older and fluent speakers of Jeju will also lengthen the final vowel of both clauses in [[alternative question]]s.{{sfn|Ko M.|Kim W.|Byun G.|Kim Jo.-h.|2007|pp=37–38}}

Jeju is [[morphological typology|typologically]] similar to Korean, both being [[head-final]] [[agglutinative]] languages.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|p=345, ''passim''}} However, the two languages show significant differences in the verbal paradigm, such as Jeju's use of a dedicated conditional suffix.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=11}}

=== Nouns ===

Jeju nouns may be a single [[morpheme]], a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of multiple nouns, or a base noun with a merged attributive verb, or form through [[morphological derivation|derivational]] affixes attached to nouns or verb stems.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=37, 42–45}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=45–63}} In compound nouns that include a native morpheme, the phoneme {{lang|jje|-s-}} may intervene between the two elements.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=87–88, 240–241}} Because this "in-between ''{{IPA|s}}''" appears only after a vowel and before a consonant, it is never realized as {{IPA|[s]}} but almost always surfaces as {{IPA|[t̚]}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=48–49}}

* Single-morpheme noun: {{lang|jje|쉐}} {{transl|jje|swe}} "cattle"
* Noun compound:
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| 쉐 + 궤기 → 쉐궤기
| swe {} gwegi {} swe-gwegi
| "cattle" {} "meat" {} "beef"|}}
* Noun compound with ''{{IPA|-s-}}'':
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| 다리 + 빙 → 다릿빙
| dari {} bing {} dari-t-bing
| "leg" {} "illness" {} {"leg illness"}|}}
* Noun with merged attributive verb:
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| 앚- + 일 → 앚인일
| aj- {} il {} aj-in-il
| {"to sit"} {} "work" {} {"work done while sitting"}|}}
* Noun derived from noun through affix:
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| ᄌᆞᆷ → ᄌᆞᆷ주시
| jawm {} jawm-jusi
| "sleep" {} "sleepyhead"|}}
* Noun derived from verb through affix:
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| 먹- → 먹쉬
| meog- {} meog-swi
| {"to eat"} {} "glutton"|}}
* [[Verbal noun]]:
{{fs interlinear|lang=jje|indent=3
| ᄃᆞᆺ- → ᄃᆞᆺ임
| daws- {} daws-im
| {"to be warm"} {} "warmth"|}}

(Examples from Yang C., Yang S, and O'Grady 2019 and Ko J. 2011a{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=37, 42–45}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=45–63}})

Some Jeju nouns are bound nouns, meaning that they cannot appear independently without a noun phrase.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=45–46}} The example below features the bound noun {{lang|jje|침}} {{transl|jje|chim}} "worth" accompanied by the obligatory attributive verb.

<blockquote>
{{fs interlinear
|볼 '''침''' 읏저
|bo-l '''chim''' eus-jeo
|see-FUT.ATTR '''worth''' not.be-DEC
|"hardly worth seeing"{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=46}}}}
</blockquote>

Jeju has two suffixing plural markers, which are obligatory for plural nouns accompanied by [[determiners]] and optional otherwise. The plural marker {{lang|jje|-덜}} {{transl|jje|-deol}} can occur with all nouns and pronouns. The marker {{lang|jje|-네}} {{transl|jje|-ne}} is restricted for humans and pronouns, and can also have an associative meaning: e.g. {{lang|jje|만수네}} {{transl|jje|Mansu-ne}} "Mansu and his family" ({{literal translation|Mansu and his associates}}). The combined sequence {{lang|jje|-네덜}} {{transl|jje|-ne-deol}} is sometimes also used.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=46–48}}

Nouns accompanied by [[numeral system|numerals]] usually take a variety of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], such as {{lang|jje|재}} {{transl|jje|jae}} for counting trees and {{lang|jje|곡지}} {{transl|jje|gokji}} for counting songs. Classifiers for [[cardinal numeral|cardinals]] are unmarked, but those for [[ordinal numeral|ordinals]] are followed by the ordinal-marking {{lang|jje|체}} {{transl|jje|che}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=74–78}}

<blockquote>
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
{{fs interlinear|낭 ᄒᆞᆫ '''재'''|nang hawn '''jae'''|tree one CLF|"one tree"}}
{{Col-2}}
{{fs interlinear|낭 두 '''재''' 체|nang du '''jae''' che|tree two CLF ORD|"the second tree"}}
{{Col-end}}
</blockquote>

==== Noun particles ====

Jeju marks [[noun case]] and other semantic relations through suffixing [[noun particles]].{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=50, 57}} Particles that mark the nominative, accusative, and genitive cases are very frequently omitted.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=373}} The table below is not exhaustive and lists only some of the most significant particles.

=== Verbs ===

The Jeju verb consists of a root that is followed by suffixes that provide grammatical information such as [[voice (grammar)|voice]], [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect, mood]], [[evidentiality]], [[honorifics (linguistics)|relative social status]], and the formality of the utterance. Jeju verbs include not only action verbs familiar to English speakers such as {{lang|jje|먹다}} {{transl|jje|meokda}} "to eat" or {{lang|jje|베리다}} {{transl|jje|berida}} "to see," but also adjectival verbs such as {{lang|jje|버치다}} {{transl|jje|beochida}} "to be heavy" or {{lang|jje|훍다}} {{transl|jje|hultta}} "to be thick."{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=93–94}} Verbs can take [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes to form [[adverb]]s and nouns.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=44–45, 116}}

* {{lang|jje|ᄇᆞ디-}} {{transl|jje|bawdi-}} "to be close"{{sfn|Dictionary|2009|p=475}} →  {{lang|jje|ᄇᆞ디'''게'''}} {{transl|jje|bawdi-'''ge'''}} "close'''ly'''"
* {{lang|jje|궂-}} {{transl|jje|guj-}} "to be bad" →  {{lang|jje|궂'''임'''}} {{transl|jje|guj-'''im'''}} "bad'''ness'''"
* {{lang|jje|입-}} {{transl|jje|ib-}} "to wear" →  {{lang|jje|입'''기'''}} {{transl|jje|ip-'''gi'''}} "wear'''ing'''"

Especially for [[wh-question]]s and exclamations, Jeju speakers commonly use a verbal noun in place of a verb inflected for tense-aspect-mood.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=103–104}}

<blockquote>
{{fs interlinear
|날도 영 ᄃᆞᆺ'''임'''광!

}}
</blockquote>

Verbs may also be given an [[attributive verb|attributive]] meaning through one of four adnominal suffixes.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=231}}

==== Pre-final suffixes ====

Jeju has a number of pre-final verbal suffixes: [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers which follow the verb stem but cannot appear at the end of the inflected verb.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011b|pp=9–10}} The exact number of these suffixes is unclear because scholars disagree on the correct morphological [[segment (linguistics)|segmentation]]. One analysis of the suffix paradigm, as presented in Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019, is given below.

[[File:Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's Jeju verb.png|frameless|center|600x449px]]

There is relatively widespread agreement on the existence of the following four discrete TAM morphemes, presented in the order they co-occur: the [[continuative aspect]] marker {{lang|jje|어ᇝ}} {{transl|jje|-eoms}}, the [[perfective aspect]] marker {{lang|jje|엇}} {{transl|jje|-eos}}, the [[irrealis mood|prospective mood]] marker {{lang|jje|읔}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)k}}, and the [[realis mood]] marker {{lang|jje|(으)느}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)neu}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=120}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=128–129}}{{sfn|Ko J.|Song S.|Kim Jee-h.|Oh C.|2014|pp=144–147, 164}} Depending on the analysis of the [[#Vowel phonological processes|aforementioned]] epenthetical vowels that precede many verbal suffixes, the base forms of the three morphemes may alternately be analyzed as {{lang|jje|엄시}} {{transl|jje|-eomsi}}, {{lang|jje|어시}} {{transl|jje|-eosi}}, {{lang|jje|크}} {{transl|jje|-keu}}, and {{lang|jje|느}} {{transl|jje|-neu}}.{{sfn|Ko J.|Song S.|Kim Jee-h.|Oh C.|2014|pp=168–176}}

{{transl|jje|-eoms(i)}} is an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or [[continuative aspect]] particle, referring to a process perceived as ongoing and similar to the English construction "be VERB-ing."{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=120}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Ko Y.|2008|p=125}} With an adjectival verb, it has an [[inchoative aspect|inchoative]] ("beginning to; become") meaning. A verb with {{transl|jje|-eoms(i)}} is interpreted as either present or future by default,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=120}} and some analyses interpret the particle as also conveying the present tense for specific events and states.{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=184–187}}{{sfn|Hong C.|2001|pp=291–293}} The suffix has a vowel-harmonic variant {{transl|jje|-ams(i)}}, as well as allomorphs {{transl|jje|-yeoms(i)}}, {{transl|jje|-yams(i)}}, and {{transl|jje|-ms(i)}} when following certain vowels.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=120}}

<blockquote>

Often characterized as a [[perfective aspect]] marker,{{sfn|Ko Y.|2008|pp=107–110}}{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=124–126}} {{transl|jje|-eos(i)}} has also been described as a [[present perfect]] marker{{sfn|Ko Y.|2008|p=115}} and as behaving as a perfective marker with some verbs and as a past tense marker with others.{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=175–176, 199–200}} {{transl|jje|-eos(i)}} can express non-past events in certain constructions that call for verbs "conceptualized in their entirety," such as a hypothetical future event. In adjectival verbs, it may also refer to a current state that contrasts with a past situation.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=124–126}} {{transl|jje|-eos(i)}} can also be doubled for a [[habitual aspect|habitual]] or a [[past perfect]] interpretation.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=144}} Also like {{transl|jje|-eoms}}, this suffix takes the vowel-harmonic variant {{transl|jje|-as(i)}} and has allomorphs {{transl|jje|-yeos(i)}}, {{transl|jje|-yas(i)}}, and {{transl|jje|-s(i)}} after certain vowels.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=124}}

The prospective mood marker {{lang|jje|읔/으크}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)k/(eu)keu}}{{efn|name=Epenthetical}} marks the subject's [[volition (linguistics)|intention]] in first-person-subject declarative sentences or second-person-subject interrogative sentences, and the speaker's conjecture otherwise. {{transl|jje|-(eu)k}} may also have a future-tense interpretation.{{sfn|Woo C.|2008|pp=71–72}}

{{Col-end}}
</blockquote>

{{transl|jje|-(eu)k}} can only be followed by a small number of suffixes in Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's analysis.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=128}} Some analyses treat the initial vowel of the following suffix as part of an allomorph or nuanced variant of {{transl|jje|-(eu)k}}, so that {{lang|jje|가커라}} {{transl|jje|gakeora}} "[I] will go" may be segmented as {{transl|jje|ga-k-eora}} or {{transl|jje|ga-keo-ra}}.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=195–196}}

The [[realis mood|realis]] or [[indicative mood]] marker {{lang|jje|(으)느}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)neu}}{{efn|name=Epenthetical}} indicates "a fact or habitual action in the nonpast"{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=128}} which the speaker perceives to be true in general, permanently, or over a longer duration of time, as demonstrated in the contrast below.{{sfn|Woo C.|2005|pp=399–400}}{{sfn|Ko J.|Song S.|Kim Jee-h.|Oh C.|2014|p=164}} The putative non-past-tense marker {{transl|jje|-(eu)n}} may also be analyzed as an allomorph of {{transl|jje|-(eu)neu}}.{{sfn|Woo C.|2005|p=387}} In this context, the morpheme {{transl|jje|-(eu)n(eu)}} has also been interpreted as a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] marker (not to be confused with the perfective marker).{{sfn|Ko Y.|2008|p=123}}

The existence of the Korean subject-[[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]] marker {{lang|jje|(으)시}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)si}} is controversial for Jeju, with some scholars arguing that it was entirely absent and others that it was restricted to higher [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]].{{sfn|Ko J.|Song S.|Kim Jee-h.|Oh C.|2014|p=154}} Ko J. 2011b notes that it was used only "by officials while referring to people of very high status and by the ''[[seonbi]]'' of the educated classes."<ref>"지체가 높은 사람을 대하는 관료층과 식자층의 선비들" {{harvnb|Ko J.|2011b|p=22}}</ref>

==== Segmenting verb-final suffixes ====

The segmentation of verb-final elements is controversial. The two recent extensive treatments of the topic, Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019<ref name=":0">{{harvnb|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=119–229}}, summarized with some variation (e.g. analysis of {{transl|jje|-neun}} as a single morpheme) in {{harvnb|Yang S.|2020}}</ref> and Kim Jee-hong 2015,<ref>{{harvnb|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=76–395}}, summarized in English with some variation in {{harvnb|Kim Jee-h.|2017}}</ref> give incompatible analyses of the suffix paradigm.

Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019 includes a slot for [[grammatical tense|tense]] in the Jeju verb, with three dedicated markers.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=130–142}}

* Non-past tense: {{lang|jje|은}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)n}}{{efn|name=Epenthetical}}
* Past tense: {{lang|jje|언}} {{transl|jje|-eon}}, with vowel-harmonic allomorph {{lang|jje|안}} {{transl|jje|-an}}
* Future tense: {{lang|jje|을}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)l}}{{efn|name=Epenthetical}}

They further divide verb-final suffixes into three categories: Type 1, which cannot occur with tense markers; Type 2, which must occur with either a tense marker or the aspect marker {{transl|jje|-eoms}}, which loses its underlying {{IPA|-s}} before a Type 2 suffix; and a mixed type, which can occur with the non-past marker but not with the other two tense markers. The vast majority of suffixes are categorized as Tense 1 and thus cannot follow a tense marker.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=162–165, 230}} Uniquely among pre-final suffixes, the past tense marker {{transl|jje|-eon}} can also appear without a final suffix.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=138}}

Examples of Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's segmentation are given below.

<blockquote>
{|
! width="50%" | Aspect + Type 1 sequence
!
! width="50%" | Tense + Type 2 sequence
|- valign=top
| {{fs interlinear|지슬 ᄆᆞᆫ 데꼇어라.|jiseul mawn dekky-eos-eora{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=170}}|potato all throw-PFV-SE|"[I noticed that he/she] had thrown away all the potatoes."}}

|}
</blockquote>

In Kim Jee-hong's analysis, verb-final single morphemes are termed "canonical endings." Canonical endings are contrasted with a wide variety of "non-canonical endings," formed by the fusion of various grammatical elements such as multiple canonical endings, truncated conjunctive and embedded sentences, and bound nouns{{efn|Called "formative" by Kim Jee-hong}} connected to the verb stem or a canonical ending via an attributive or a nominalizer.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=106–109}}{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2017|pp=237–249}} The most common canonical component of these non-canonical endings is the suffix {{lang|jje|어}} {{transl|jje|-eo}} (vowel-harmonic allomorph {{lang|jje|아}} {{transl|jje|-a}}), which Kim calls the [[unmarked]] "default ending."{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2017|pp=239–240}}{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|p=128}}

Since Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's tenses align with the aforementioned attributive suffixes,{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=172–175}} sentences they analyze as "Tense-Type 2 Suffix" sequences are often analyzed as non-canonical endings with a "Canonical ending-Attributive-Bound noun" composition by Kim Jee-hong. Many of Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's Type 1 suffixes are also interpreted as polymorphemic non-canonical endings. Kim Jee-hong also segments some of Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's mixed-type suffixes so that the base form of the suffix includes the {{transl|jje|-n}} of the latter's non-past tense marker.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=223, 349}}

Examples from Kim Jee-hong 2015's analysis, directly corresponding to the examples above of Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019, are given below. The "default ender" {{transl|jje|-eo}} is bolded.

==== Sentence enders ====

Jeju has a number of clause-final suffixes, called "sentence enders" in Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=161}} and "terminal suffixes" ({{lang-ko|종결어미}} {{transl|ko|jonggyeol eomi}}) in Korean,{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|p=78}} that provide information such as degree of formality, social status, evidentality, and modality.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=161}} Sentence enders may consist of one or multiple morphemes.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=128}}{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=106–109}} Kim Jee-hong argues for four [[Korean speech levels|speech levels]] in Jeju, defined by the degree of formality and deference their sentence enders connote: informal and plain (non-honorific); formal and plain; informal and honorific, marked by the morpheme {{lang|jje|우}} {{transl|jje|-u-}}, and formal and honorific, featuring the morpheme {{lang|jje|읍}} {{transl|jje|-eup}}.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=233–236}} An archaic speech level showing extreme deference is attested from shamanic chants.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=100–101}}

As different segmentation hypotheses produce different sentence enders. the chart below will list only a small, illustrative sample of the dozens of suffixes that appear in Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019 and Kim Jee-h. 2015. The classification is based on Kim Jee-hong 2017,{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2017|pp=239–241, 245, 248}} which differs from Kim Jee-hong 2015.{{efn|Kim Jee-hong 2015 classifies all endings that can be followed by the deferential marker {{transl|jje|massim}} as informal, but Kim Jee-hong 2017 does so only for non-canonical endings.}}

 || Kim Jee-hong considers {{transl|jje|-eo}} the [[unmarked]] sentence ender. Depending on [[suprasegmentals]], the suffix may be used in a plain statement, a question, a command, an exclamation, or a construction in which the speaker informs the addressee of information that the latter did not know and expects a confirmatory response. The suffix is also found in Standard Korean with a similar degree of versatility and widespread use.

 || According to Kim Jee-hong, {{transl|jje|-ju}} conveys a statement of presumption or assumption without direct supporting experience, and invites the addressee to confirm the statement's veracity. Kim also states that {{transl|jje|-ju}} may end a confirmatory question with the implication that the addressee should agree with the speaker.

According to Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady, {{transl|jje|-ju}} expresses a statement of intention or strong assertion with a first-person subject and a statement of judgement or assumption with a third-person subject, and may also convey regret or advice.

 || {{fs interlinear|날 우쳣인게.|nal uchy-eos-i(-)'''n-ge'''|"[I see that] the day was cloudy."}}
 || {{transl|jje|(-eun)-ge}} generally conveys a statement of fact that the speaker has directly observed, or has inferred from a direct observation.

In Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019, the suffix is given as {{transl|jje|-ge}}, a special Type 2 suffix which can only combine with the two tense markers ending in {{transl|jje|-n}}. Kim Jee-hong classifies it as a non-canonical ending composed of a fused attributive {{transl|jje|-eun}} and bound noun.

 || {{transl|jje|(-eu)men}} is used for both statements and questions, but only when the speaker and addressee are emotionally intimate. When the verb is inflected for aspect, {{transl|jje|(-eu)men}} is used to refer to a past event that was observed or inferred from observation. If uninflected, the suffix denotes an ongoing event.

The honorific verbs, which show deference to the addressee, are formed by a special suffix that can be followed only by a small number of sentence enders.

The informal honorific forms are marked by {{lang|jje|우}} {{transl|jje|-u-}} or {{lang|jje|(으)우}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)u-}}.{{efn|name=Epenthetical}} The former is used with the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb {{lang|jje|이다}} {{transl|jje|ida}} and with all inflected verbs, and the latter is used with uninflected adjectival verbs. {{transl|jje|-u-}} and {{transl|jje|-(eu)u-}} may take the alternative form {{lang|jje|수}} {{transl|jje|-su-}} after a verb inflected for aspect and a non-liquid consonant, respectively.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=218–219}} The informal honorific form cannot occur with uninflected action verbs.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=97–99}} The two suffixes may only be followed by the sentence enders in the table below.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=217–226}}{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=228–235}} Informal honorific requests cannot be formed morphologically.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|pp=228–235}}

==== Connectives ====

Jeju uses an array of verb-final connective suffixes to link clauses within sentences,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=230}} much as English does with [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] such as ''and'', ''or'', ''that'', ''but'', and ''because''.

Some Jeju connectives, such as the suffixes {{lang|jje|언/엉}} {{transl|jje|-eon/eong}} "and", occur in pairs with one variant ending in {{transl|jje|-n}} and the other in {{transl|jje|-ng}}. Hong Chong-rim and Song Sang-jo both note that the choice between {{transl|jje|-n}} and {{transl|jje|-ng}} is often determined by the inflections of the subsequent clause; certain pre-final suffixes and sentence enders require a {{transl|jje|n}}-connective in the previous clause, while others require a {{transl|jje|ng}}-connective.{{sfn|Hong C.|2001|pp=276–286}}{{sfn|Song S.|2011|pp=35–49}} Hong suggests that {{transl|jje|-n}} is used for specific and objective events and states, while {{transl|jje|-ng}} implies a general and subjective event or state.{{sfn|Hong C.|2001|pp=295–297}} Song argues that {{transl|jje|-n}} is used for completed or achieved verbs, and {{transl|jje|-ng}} for incomplete or unachieved verbs.{{sfn|Song S.|2011|pp=19–30}} The nuances below are thus possible.{{sfn|Song S.|2011|pp=6–9}}{{sfn|Hong C.|2001|p=299}}

{{Col-end}}
</blockquote>

The distinction between {{transl|jje|-n}} and {{transl|jje|-ng}} does not exist in mainland Korean [[language variety|varieties]].{{sfn|Hong C.|2001|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Song S.|2011|pp=vi–vii}} Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019 reports that "the contrast between {{transl|jje|-eong}} and {{transl|jje|-eon}} appears to be disappearing, and the distinctions that remain are subtle and variable."{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=120}}

An important class of connectives, used for reporting speech and thoughts, is formed by the suffix {{lang|jje|엔/엥}} {{transl|jje|-en/-eng}}, which fuses with sentence enders as in the example of {{transl|jje|-da}} below.{{sfn|Kim M.|2019|pp=35–39, 44–49}}

<blockquote>
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
{{fs interlinear|"감ㅅ우'''다'''."{{efn|name=감}}|ga-ms-su-'''da'''|go-CONT-HON-SE|"'I am going.'"}}
{{Col-2}}
{{fs interlinear|감ㅅ'''덴''' ᄀᆞᆯ앗수다.{{efn|name=감|감/감수 instead of government-orthography 감ㅅ/감ㅅ우 in original source}}|ga-ms-'''den''' gawr-at-su-da|go-CONT-REP say-PFV-HON-SE|"[S/he] said that [s/he] was going."}}
{{Col-end}}
</blockquote>

Similarly, informal honorific conjectural {{transl|jje|k-u-da}} becomes {{lang|jje|켄}} {{transl|jje|-ken}}; plain forms {{transl|jje|-ju}} and {{transl|jje|-jeo}} become {{lang|jje|젠}} {{transl|jje|-jen}}; question enders {{transl|jje|-ga}} and {{transl|jje|-go}} become {{lang|jje|겐}} {{transl|jje|-gen}} and {{lang|jje|곤}} {{transl|jje|-gon}}; honorific imperative {{transl|jje|-eup-seo}} becomes {{lang|jje|읍센}} {{transl|jje|-eup-sen}}; and so forth.{{sfn|Kim M.|2019|pp=35–39, 44–49}} These fused suffixes may be used for both [[quotative]] and [[indirect speech|reportive]] purposes. In Standard Korean, indirect speech is strictly distinguished from the quotative by the removal of addressee honorifics and the switching of pronouns. In Jeju, the lines between direct and indirect speech are more blurred. All four forms below—given in order of increasing indirectness—are in use, and have the same meaning, "He said [to a superior] that he was going home."{{sfn|Kim M.|2019|pp=39–43}}{{efn|name=감}}

</blockquote>

Other connectives include {{lang|jje|(으)민}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)min}} "if"; {{lang|jje|(으)난}} {{transl|jje|-(eu)nan}} "because"; and {{lang|jje|단/당}} {{transl|jje|-dan/dang}} "after".{{efn|name=AlwaysEpenthetical}}{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=255–256, 262–265}}

==== Auxiliary and light verbs ====

Jeju has many [[auxiliary verbs]] that are linked to the preceding main verb by the morpheme {{lang|jje|어/아}} {{transl|jje|-eo/a}}.{{efn|name=VowelHarmony}} These include {{lang|jje|안네다}} {{transl|jje|anneda}} "to give," for an action that benefits a superior; {{lang|jje|불다}} {{transl|jje|bulda}} "to throw away," for an action yielding a complete result; and {{lang|jje|지다}} {{transl|jje|jida}} "to become," for a change of state. {{transl|jje|Jida}} is also used to indicate ability.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=96–101}}

<blockquote>
{{fs interlinear
|일 하영 헤노난 죽'''어지'''켜.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=99}}
|il hayeong he-nonan jug-'''eo-ji'''-k-yeo
|work a.lot do-because die-'''''eo''-become'''-PROSP-SE
|"I will become close to dying because I work a lot."}}
</blockquote>

Jeju also uses [[light verb]]s, which have little semantic meaning but combine with nouns to form verbs. The most common light verb is {{lang|jje|ᄒᆞ다}} {{transl|jje|hawda}} "to do," e.g. {{lang|jje|부름씨}} {{transl|jje|bureumssi}} "errand" → {{lang|jje|부름씨ᄒᆞ다}} {{transl|jje|bureumssi-hawda}} "to run an errand".{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=101–103}} There is also a large inventory of [[periphrastic]] phrases that convey modality.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=153–160}}

=== Post-phrasal particles ===

Jeju has a small group of particles that commonly occur at the very end of phrases or sentences, many of which play important roles as [[discourse markers]]. The four principal ones are the formality marker {{lang|jje|마씀}} {{transl|jje|-masseum}} and the emphatic markers {{lang|jje|게}} {{transl|jje|-ge}}, {{lang|jje|이}} {{transl|jje|-i}}, and {{lang|jje|양}} {{transl|jje|-yang}}.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=227–229}}

{{transl|jje|-masseum}} (variants {{lang|jje|마씸}} {{transl|jje|-massim}}, {{lang|jje|마씨}} {{transl|jje|-massi}}) may occur after subsentential phrases such as a bare or case-inflected noun, or attach to a small number of mostly plain sentence enders.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=227–228}} The particle shows the speaker's deference towards the addressee, but is considered more emotionally intimate than the verbally inflected honorifics. In certain contexts, {{transl|jje|-masseum}} may be used with an intention to snub the addressee.{{sfn|Moon S.|2005a|pp=3–7}}

{{transl|jje|-ge}} is a discourse marker that attaches to adverbs, nouns and noun particles, and both sentence enders and connectives. It adds emphasis to the [[utterance]]{{sfn|Moon S.|2003|pp=72–80}} and is often used to agree with or confirm something the addressee has just said.{{sfn|Yang C.|Kim W.|2013|pp=157–160}} {{transl|jje|-i}} is used similarly to {{transl|jje|-ge}}, but is weaker in its emphasis.{{sfn|Moon S.|2003|pp=80–82}} Both cannot be used while addressing a social superior, and {{transl|jje|-i}} also cannot appear in formal speech.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=228–229}} Both particles can also appear in isolation: {{transl|jje|ge}} as a strong affirmation to a question, {{transl|jje|i}} as an indication that the speaker has not heard or does not believe what has been said.{{sfn|Moon S.|2003|pp=72, 80}}

{{transl|jje|-yang}} shows deference, but is considered more informal than {{transl|jje|-masseum}}.{{sfn|Moon S.|2005a|p=11}} At the end of a sentence, it emphasizes the speaker's beliefs or attitudes. For example, a question becomes a rhetorical one when {{transl|jje|-yang}} is attached: {{lang|jje|이시카}} {{transl|jje|is-ik-a}} "Could there be?" → {{lang|jje|이시카'''양'''}} {{transl|jje|is-ik-a-'''yang'''}} "How could there be?"{{sfn|Yang C.|2009|pp=22–24}} The particle is also commonly used for sarcastic mock deference, such as by parents while scolding children.{{sfn|Moon S.|2005a|pp=9–10}} Sentence-initially or internally, the suffix may establish the preceding element as the topic of discourse.{{sfn|Yang C.|2009|pp=202–201}} {{transl|jje|Yang}} is also used in isolation as an [[interjection]] to get the attention of unfamiliar individuals, such as a shopkeeper, or to request the addressee to repeat what they have just said.{{sfn|Moon S.|2005b|pp=164–171}}

In the example below from Yang C. 2009, three of the four particles discussed above are used.{{sfn|Yang C.|2009|p=21}}

=== Pronouns and deixis ===

|}

According to Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019, there are four basic [[deictic]] [[demonstratives]] in Jeju.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=83}} Most other sources mention three, which are identical to those of Standard Korean.{{sfn|Kim Jee-h.|2015|p=398}}{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=190–191}}{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=135–136}}

* Proximal: {{lang|jje|이}} {{transl|jje|i}} "this"
* Medial or absent: {{lang|jje|그}} {{transl|jje|geu}} "that"
* Distal: {{lang|jje|저}} {{transl|jje|jeo}} "that"

== Vocabulary ==

Most of the Jeju lexicon is [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]], and "a sizeable number" of words are identical with Korean.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=9–10}} There are [[false friends]] between the languages, such as Korean {{lang|ko|감다}} {{transl|ko|gamda}} "to wash hair" and Jeju {{lang|jje|ᄀᆞᆷ다}} {{transl|jje|gawmda}} "to wash the body."{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=9–10}} Jeju also preserves many [[Middle Korean]] terms now lost in Korean, such as {{lang|jje|갓}} {{transl|jje|gat}} "wife; woman" and {{lang|jje|어시}} {{transl|jje|eosi}} "parent."{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=259–270}} Like Korean, Jeju uses many [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] words based on local readings of [[Classical Chinese]].{{sfn|Ko D.|Song S.|Oh C.|Moon S.|2015|pp=74–78}}

Jeju Island was ruled by the Mongols in the late thirteenth century and some [[Middle Mongol]] terms still survive in the language, though the extent of Mongol influence is disputed. Popular claims of hundreds of Mongol loans in Jeju are linguistically unsound.{{sfn|Kwon S.|2017|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|p=481}} Uncontroversial Mongol loans are most common in terms relating to animal husbandry.{{sfn|Kwon S.|2017|pp=55–62}}

Jeju may have loans from an ancient Japonic substratum.{{sfn|Vovin|2013|pp=236–237}} As the last fluent generation of Jeju speakers were born under or shortly after Japanese rule, remaining speakers also use many loans from Modern Japanese.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=348–350}}

=== Sound symbolism ===

Jeju has widespread [[sound symbolism]] in [[ideophones]].{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|p=2}} The use of sound symbolism to form emphatic variants of words is more common in Jeju than in Seoul Korean.{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|p=4}}

Jeju sound symbolism operates with both consonants and vowels. The intensity of a Jeju word may be strengthened by using tense and especially aspirate obstruents.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=251–252}}{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|pp=10–12}} The sound symbolism may also be emphasized through the addition of consonants,{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|pp=5–6}} by adding the sequence {{lang|jje|-락}} {{transl|jje|-rak}} to both reduplicated segments, and with [[fortition]] or [[lenition]].{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|pp=5, 7, 9}} The ''yang'' harmonic class of vowels has a bright, small connotation, and the ''yin'' vowel class gives a dark, large connotation.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=250}} Ko Jae-hwan also gives examples of three or four layers of vowel sound symbolism.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011|pp=255–258}}

* Consonant sound symbolism:
** {{lang|jje|고시롱}} {{transl|jje|'''g'''osirong}} "savory" → {{lang|jje|꼬시롱}} {{transl|jje|'''kk'''osirong}} "[very] savory" → {{lang|jje|코시롱}} {{transl|jje|'''k'''osirong}} "[extremely] savory"{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=252}}
** {{lang|jje|을강을강}} {{transl|jje|eulgang-eulgang}} "[small] sound of rat gnawing teeth" → {{lang|jje|글강글강}} {{transl|jje|'''g'''eulgang-'''g'''eulgang}} "[large] sound of rat gnawing teeth"{{sfn|Dictionary|2009|p=110}}
** {{lang|jje|ᄇᆞᆯ착ᄇᆞᆯ착}} {{transl|jje|bawlchak-bawlchak}} "easily angered" → {{lang|jje|ᄇᆞᆯ치락ᄇᆞᆯ치락}} {{transl|jje|bawlchi'''rak'''-bawlchi'''rak'''}} "[very] easily angered}{{sfn|Dictionary|2009|p=478}}
** {{lang|jje|크뜽크뜽}} {{transl|jje|keu'''tt'''eung-keu'''tt'''eung}} "neatly aligned" → {{lang|jje|코찡코찡}} {{transl|jje|ko'''jj'''ing-ko'''jj'''ing}} "[very] neatly aligned"{{efn|Given with {{lang|jje|크}} {{transl|jje|keu}}, {{lang|jje|코}} {{transl|jje|ko}} in Kang S. 2008,{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|p=7}} but both forms given with {{lang|jje|ᄏᆞ}} {{transl|jje|kaw}} in the 2009 ''Dictionary of the Jeju Language''{{sfn|Dictionary|2009|p=840}}}}
* Vowel sound symbolism:
** {{lang|jje|동골동골}} {{transl|jje|d'''o'''ngg'''o'''l-d'''o'''ngg'''o'''l}} "round [of a small object]" → {{lang|jje|둥굴둥굴}} {{transl|jje|d'''u'''ngg'''u'''l-d'''u'''ngg'''u'''l}} "round [of a large object]"{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=250}}
** {{lang|jje|ᄋᆞᆼ당ᄋᆞᆼ당}} {{transl|jje|'''aw'''ngdang-'''aw'''ngdang}} "[small and light] sound of muttered complaints" → {{lang|jje|옹당옹당}} {{transl|jje|'''o'''ngdang-'''o'''ngdang}} "[large and heavy] sound of muttered complaints" → {{lang|jje|웅당웅당}} {{transl|jje|'''u'''ngdang-'''u'''ngdang}} "[very large and very heavy] sound of muttered complaints"{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=255}}
** {{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆫ들ᄆᆞᆫ들}} {{transl|jje|m'''aw'''ndeul-m'''aw'''ndeul}} "smooth to the touch [of a very small or dry object]" → {{lang|jje|맨들맨들}} {{transl|jje|m'''ae'''ndeul-m'''ae'''ndeul}} "smooth to the touch [of a somewhat small or dry object]" → {{lang|jje|문들문들}} {{transl|jje|m'''u'''ndeul-m'''u'''ndeul}} "slippery to the touch [of a somewhat large or wet object]" → {{lang|jje|민들민들}} {{transl|jje|m'''i'''ndeul-m'''i'''ndeul}} "slippery to the touch [of a very large or wet object]"{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=258}}

Multiple sound-symbolic strategies may combine in a single word. Kang S. 2008 gives eight sound symbolic variants of the ideophone {{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆯ탁ᄆᆞᆯ탁}} {{transl|jje|mawltak-mawltak}} "the shape of many objects being blunt," each more intense than the other:{{sfn|Kang S.|2008|p=2}}

<blockquote>
{{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆯ탁ᄆᆞᆯ탁}} {{transl|jje|mawltak-mawltak}} → {{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆯ트락ᄆᆞᆯ트락}} {{transl|jje|mawlteu'''rak'''-mawlteu'''rak'''}} → {{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆯ착ᄆᆞᆯ착}} {{transl|jje|mawl'''ch'''ak-mawl'''ch'''ak}} → {{lang|jje|ᄆᆞᆯ치락ᄆᆞᆯ치락}} {{transl|jje|mawlchi'''rak'''-mawlchi'''rak'''}} → {{lang|jje|뫁탁몰탁}} {{transl|jje|m'''o'''ltak-m'''o'''ltak}} →  {{lang|jje|몰착몰착}} {{transl|jje|mol'''ch'''ak-mol'''ch'''ak}} → {{lang|jje|몰트락몰트락}} {{transl|jje|mol'''teurak'''-mol'''teurak'''}} → {{lang|jje|몰치락몰치락}} {{transl|jje|mol'''chi'''rak-mol'''chi'''rak}}
</blockquote>

=== Kinship terminology ===

The [[kinship terminology]] of Jeju has been the focus of particular attention.{{sfn|Jeju Province|2019a|p=481}} Jeju has a complex kinship system that distinguishes the gender of both the speaker and the relative. Gender distinctions are particularly noticeable in sibling terminology. The words {{lang|jje|성}} {{transl|jje|seong}} and {{lang|jje|아시}} {{transl|jje|asi}} refer to "older same-gender sibling" and "younger same-gender sibling" respectively, while {{lang|jje|오라방}} {{transl|jje|orabang}} and {{lang|jje|누이}} {{transl|jje|nui}} refer specifically to "brother of a female" and "sister of a male" respectively.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=38–39}} Female speakers also tend to refer to relatives with native compounds, whereas male speakers prefer Sino-Korean terms. For instance, the same cousin may be referred to by a man as {{lang|jje|ᄉᆞ춘}} {{transl|jje|sawchun}} "cousin" but by a woman as {{lang|jje|고모님 ᄄᆞᆯ}} {{transl|jje|gomo-nim ttawl}} "paternal aunt's daughter."{{sfn|Kim M.|2010|pp=40, 43}} A major distinction between Jeju and Korean kinship terms is that women do not use honorifics to refer to their in-laws, reflecting weaker historical influence from [[Confucian]] patriarchal norms.{{sfn|Kim M.|2010|pp=34, 40, 43}}

Jeju also uses supplementary prefixes to clarify the type of kinship, equivalent to "step-" or "maternal" in English.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=40–42}} These include {{lang|jje|친-}} {{transl|jje|chin-}}, {{lang|jje|성-}} {{transl|jje|seong-}}, and {{lang|jje|당-}} {{transl|jje|dang-}} for paternal relations, {{lang|jje|웨-}} {{transl|jje|we-}} for maternal relations, {{lang|jje|다슴-}} {{transl|jje|daseum-}} for step-relations,{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=40}} {{lang|jje|처-}} {{transl|jje|cheo-}} and {{lang|jje|가시-}} {{transl|jje|gasi-}} for a male's in-laws, and {{lang|jje|시-}} {{transl|jje|si-}} for a woman's in-laws.{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|p=274}} Five other prefixes, which may be combined, mark relative age: {{lang|jje|쳇-}} {{transl|jje|chet-}} or {{lang|jje|큰-}} {{transl|jje|keun-}} "eldest," {{lang|jje|셋-}} {{transl|jje|set-}} "second eldest of three or more," {{lang|jje|말젯-}} {{transl|jje|maljet-}} "third eldest of four or more," and {{lang|jje|족은-}} {{transl|jje|jogeun-}} "youngest." These are used to distinguish relatives of the same generation.{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|pp=41–42}}

* {{lang|jje|하르방}} {{transl|jje|hareubang}} "grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|큰하르방}} {{transl|jje|keun-hareubang}} "oldest brother of one's grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|셋하르방}} {{transl|jje|set-hareubang}} "second brother of one's grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|큰말젯하르방}} {{transl|jje|keun-maljet-hareubang}} "third brother of one's grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|셋말젯하르방}} {{transl|jje|set-maljet-hareubang}} "fourth brother of one's grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|족은말젯하르방}} {{transl|jje|jogeun-maljet-hareubang}} "fifth brother of one's grandfather"
** {{lang|jje|족은하르방}} {{transl|jje|jogeun-hareubang}} "youngest brother of one's grandfather"{{sfn|Yang C.|Yang S.|O'Grady|2019|p=42}}{{sfn|Ko J.|2011a|pp=281–282}}

Other prefixes include {{lang|jje|왕-}} {{transl|jje|wang-}}, used in {{lang|jje|왕하르방}} {{transl|jje|wang-hareubang}} "great-grandfather", and {{lang|jje|넛-}} {{transl|jje|neot-}}, used to refer to a sibling of one's grandparent generally.{{sfn|Kim M.|2010|pp=30–31}}

== Sample text ==

The following is an excerpt from a version of the ''[[Menggam bon-puri]]'', one of the epic chants recited by Jeju shamans. In this myth, the poacher Song Saman discovers an abandoned skull in the hills and cares for it [[Jesa|as if it were his own ancestor]]. The skull reciprocates by warning Song Saman of his early death and advising him on how to avoid the ''[[Chasa bon-puri#Etymology|chasa]]'', the three gods of death.{{sfn|Chin S.|1991|pp=169–175}}

This version was transcribed between 1956 and 1963{{sfn|Chin S.|1991|p=39<!-- The version I have, the original version of 제주도무가본풀이사전 published on October 30, 1991, does not have page numbers for the introductory section about dates and such. Bizarrely, the first numbered page begins in p. 51, but there are only twenty-two physical pages between the cover and p. 51, even including intentionally blank pages. p.39 here means twelve pages before p. 51, essentially. -->}} from the recitation of the shaman Byeon Sin-saeng, born {{circa}} 1904.{{sfn|Chin S.|1991|p=175}} The transcription predates both standardized orthographies of Jeju. The transcriber openly notes that the orthography is inconsistent.<ref>"제주도의 발음으로서의 일률적인 통일 역시 이루지 않았고... 한 사람의 발음이 같은 뜻을 지니면서 다소 틀림이 있는 경우일지라도 이것 역시 발음 그대로를 표기했다." {{harvnb|Chin S.|1991|p=39}}</ref> No attempt was made in this article to standardize or update the orthography.
