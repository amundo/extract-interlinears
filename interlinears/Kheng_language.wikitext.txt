==Classification==
Khengkha is a dialect found in the small Himalayan kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. Khengkha is part of the larger branch of Sino-Tibetan language family but falls into the subcategories of: Tibetio-Burman, Western Tubeto-Burman, Bodish, East Bodish, Bumthang, and Khengkha.

==Geographical distribution==
Khengkha is an East Bodish language spoken in the south-central districts of [[Bhutan]]. Khengkha is mainly found in the [[Sarpang District|Sarpang]] district but can also be found in southwest [[Mongar District|Mongar]] district, rural areas in southeast [[Trongsa District|Trongsa]] district and in [[Zhemgang District|Zhemgang]] district.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Bhutan|url = https://www.ethnologue.com/map/BT|website = Ethnologue|access-date = 2015-10-28}}</ref>

===Dialects===
The three main dialects in [[Bumthang district]] are Bumthap (Lower Kheng), Khempa (Middle Kheng), and
Kurtop (Upper Kheng). Comprehension between the three dialects differs as Bumthap is the most similarly
related language, however conversation with Kurthop is difficult.

==Grammar==
In most Khengkha sentences, it only marks grammatical relations through word order. The subject constituent precedes the object and the verb constituents follow it. Khengkha follows the same typology as [[Dzongkha]]. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:<ref name=":0" />

{{interlinear|indent=3
|Ngai meng Dorji wenn.
|My name Dorji is.
|{} S      O      V
|"My name is Dorji."}}

When nouns are addressed in Khengkha there are two ways it can be written, depending on the other.

# Relatives before noun heads or articles.
# Adjectives after noun heads.

Khengkha is an oral language without a writing system, making tones and nuances important during communication.<ref name=":0" />

=== Language Use ===
Khengkha is a vigorous language in limited areas. Khengkha is not allowed to be taught in schools around [[Bhutan]], making it only spoken at home, for commerce, local politics, and traditional religion. Due to the increasing modernization of [[Bhutan]], there are negative attitudes towards those who speak Kheng instead of [[Dzongkha]] or the [[English language|English]]. Lower Kheng is considered to be spoken backward, while Middle Kheng is seen as more prestigious.  Middle Kheng region is the strongest and most developed economically, while lower Kheng is least developed.<ref name=":0" />

=== Language Development ===
Since Khengkha is an oral language there is a low [[literacy]] rate for native Khengkha speakers in [[Dzongkha]]. There is literacy rate of 20% in [[Dzongkha]].<ref name=":0" />

==Common phrases==

As there is no official English romanization of Dzongkha script, many words are spelled out phonetically. Therefore, there may be multiple spellings of the same word.

==Related languages==
Historically, Kheng and its speakers have had close contact with speakers of the [[Kurtöp language|Kurtöp]], [[Nupbi language|Nupbi]] and [[Bumthang language]]s, nearby languages of central and eastern Bhutan, to the extent that they may be considered part of a wider collection of "Bumthang languages".<ref>{{cite book|title=Bhutan: Mountain Fortress of the Gods |first=Christian |last=Schicklgruber |editor=Françoise Pommaret-Imaeda |publisher=Shambhala |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q1uAAAAMAAJ |pages=50, 53}}</ref><ref name=EEL>{{cite book|first=George |last=van Driem |author-link=George van Driem |editor-last=Moseley |editor-first=Christopher |contribution=Endangered Languages of Bhutan and Sikkim: East Bodish Languages |title=Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages |year=2007 |page=295 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-7007-1197-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LoNl7ZRO70C}}</ref><ref name=vanDriem2007>{{cite book|title=Language diversity endangered |volume=181 |series=Trends in linguistics: Studies and monographs, Mouton Reader |author-link=George van Driem |last=van Driem |first=George |page=312 |editor=Matthias Brenzinger |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2007 |isbn=3-11-017050-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p6b5GQ4Q4YC}}</ref>
