The '''Nias language''' is an [[Austronesian language]] spoken on [[Nias]] Island and the [[Batu Islands]] off the west coast of [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]]. It is known as Li Niha by its native speakers. It belongs to the [[Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands]] subgroup which also includes [[Mentawai language|Mentawai]] and the [[Batak languages]].<ref name=e18/> It had about 770,000 speakers in 2000.<ref name=e18/> There are three main [[dialect]]s: northern, central and southern.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=395}} It is an [[Syllable#open_syllable|open-syllable]] language, which means there are no syllable-final consonants.

==Dialects==
[[File:Languages of Northern Sumatra en.svg|thumb|A map of major languages spoken in northern Sumatra; Nias is represented by the blue shade and its ISO 639-3 code "nia"]]

Nias is typically considered to have three dialects.<ref name="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</ref>{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=7}}
*'''Northern''' dialect: particularly the [[Gunungsitoli]] variety, Alasa and Lahewa area.<ref name="Ethnologue" />
*'''South''' dialect: [[South Nias Regency|South Nias]], Gomo Area, [[Teluk Dalam|Telukdalam]] Area and [[Batu Islands]].<ref name="Ethnologue" />
*'''Central''' dialect: [[West Nias Regency|West Nias]], particularly in [[Kecamatan Sirombu|Sirombu]] and [[Kecamatan Mandrehe|Mandrehe]] areas.<ref name="Ethnologue" />

Cognate percentage among the dialects of Nias is about 80%.{{sfn|Nothofer|1986|p=95}}

The northern variant is considered the prestige dialect. The only complete Bible translation is written in the northern dialect and is used by speakers of all dialects.{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=8}}

==Phonology==
Nias has the following [[phoneme]]s (sounds only found in the northern dialect are given in {{color|#00C000|green}}, southern-only sounds are in {{color|#E00000|red}}):{{sfn|Sundermann|1913|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=564}}

Phonetic descriptions of the sounds traditionally written as {{angbr|mb}} and {{angbr|ndr}} greatly vary. Sundermann (1913) and Halawa et al. (1983) describe them as prenasalized stop {{IPA|[ᵐb]}} and prenasalized trilled stop {{IPA|[ⁿdʳ]}} for the northern dialect,{{sfn|Sundermann|1913|p=6}}{{sfn|Halawa|Harefa|Silitonga|1983|p=19, 21}} while Brown (2005) records them as trill {{IPA|[ʙ]}} and trilled stop {{IPA|[dʳ]}} for the southern dialect.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=564}} In an acoustic study of Nias dialects from three locations, Yoder (2010) shows a complex pattern of four phonetic realizations of {{angbr|mb}} and {{angbr|ndr}}: plain stop, prenasalized stop, stop with trilled release, stop with fricated release.{{sfn|Yoder|2010|p=1}}{{efn|"It seems that the variable character of the two phonemes is the only consistent feature that distinguishes them from the regular stops in the same places of articulation, and from the regular alveolar trill." {{harv|Yoder|2010|p=1}}}}

The status of initial {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is not determined; there are no phonetic vowel-initial words in Nias.

The contrast between {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[ʋ]}} (both written {{angle bracket|w}} in common spelling) is only observed in the southern dialect. Here, the fricative {{IPA|[v]}} only occurs in initial position in the mutated form (see [[Nias_language#Noun_case_marking_(mutation)|§Noun case marking (mutation)]]) of nouns beginning with ''f'', e.g. {{lang|nia|fakhe}} ~ {{lang|nia|wakhe}} {{IPA|[vaxe]}}.
The approximant {{IPA|[ʋ]}} can appear in initial and medial position, and is in free variation with {{IPA|[v]}} for many speakers of the southern dialect.{{sfn|Brown|2001|pp=27; 36–39}} For the northern dialect, only fricative approximant {{IPA|[ʋ]}} is reported, corresponding to both sounds of southern Nias.{{sfn|Halawa|Harefa|Silitonga|1983|p=23}} The semivowel {{IPA|[w]}} is a distinct phoneme and is written {{angle bracket|ŵ}} in common spelling.{{sfn|Halawa|Harefa|Silitonga|1983|p=39}}

==Grammar==
Nias has an [[ergative–absolutive]] alignment.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=398–399}} It is the only known ergative–absolutive language in the world that has a "marked absolutive", which means that absolutive case is marked, whereas ergative case is unmarked.{{sfn|Comrie|2013}}{{sfn|Donohue|2008|p=27}}

There are no [[adjective]]s in Nias, words with that function are taken by verbs.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=566}}

===Pronouns===

The following table lists the free and bound pronouns of Nias ({{color|#00C000|green}} = only used in the northern dialect, {{color|#E00000|red}} = only used in the southern dialect):{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=400}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|pp=123–124}}{{sfn|Sundermann|1913|pp=40–45, 65–66}}

{{interlinear|indent=4

*following certain prepositions, e.g. ''khö-gu'' "to me"
*as the S argument in nominalized intransitive clauses
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated; NR:nominalizer

|'I used the coconut which she grated.'
|c1 = (southern dialect){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=420}}}}

'''Ergative''' (realis) pronouns are used:

{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated
|'''I'''-tataba geu
|3SG.ERG-cut wood:MUT
|'He cut up the wood.'
|c1 = (southern dialect){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=529}}}}

'''Irrealis''' pronouns are used in the southern dialect:

{{interlinear|indent=4
|'''Gu'''-möi ba fasa mahemolu
|1SG.IRR-go LOC market tomorrow

|'I'm going to tell them about you.'
|c1 = (southern dialect){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=549}}}}

In the northern dialect, the irrealis pronouns are restricted to third person, and are employed in what Sundermann (1913) calls "jussive" mood.
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=JUSS:jussive mood
|'''Ya'''-mu-'ohe
|3SG.JUSS-JUSS-bring
|'He shall bring it.'

===Noun case marking (mutation)===
[[grammatical case|Case marking]] of [[noun]]s is indicated in Nias by [[consonant mutation|mutation]] of the initial consonant. Several consonants are subject to mutation as shown in the table below. Where a word begins in a vowel, either ''n'' or ''g'' is added before the vowel; the choice of ''n'' or ''g'' is lexically conditioned. (For example, ''öri ~ nöri'' is 'village federation', ''öri ~ göri'' is 'bracelet'.){{sfn|Brown|2005|p=567}}

Other consonants do not change. 

====Unmutated case====
The unmutated case form is used in citation. It further appears in all functions described above for independent pronouns:
*as the predicate in nominal clauses
*as the P argument of transitive verbs in dependent (including relative and nominalized) clauses
*following certain prepositions and ''ha'' "only"
*in fronted (topicalized) position

Additionally, A arguments in independent transitive clauses appear in unmutated case, cross-referenced by the corresponding ergative or irrealis pronoun.
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated
|I-rino vakhe '''ina-gu'''
|3SG.ERG rice:MUT mother-1SG.GEN
|'My mother cooked rice.'
|c1 = (southern dialect){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=537}}}}

====Mutated case====
The mutated case form of the noun corresponds in function to both the absolutive and the genitive pronouns:
*as the S argument of independent intransitive and nominal clauses
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated
|Mate '''zibaya-nia''' meneßi
|die uncle:MUT-3SG.GEN yesterday
|'His uncle died yesterday.'
|c1 = (southern dialect; unmutated: ''sibaya''){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=559}}}}
*as the P argument of transitive verbs in independent clauses
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated
|I-rino '''vakhe''' ina-gu
|3SG.ERG rice:MUT mother-1SG.GEN
|'My mother cooked rice.'
|c1 = (southern dialect; unmutated: ''fakhe''){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=537}}}}
*as the stimulus with intransitive verbs expressing emotions or states of mind
*as possessor
{{interlinear|indent=4|abbreviations=MUT:mutated
|omo '''ga'a-gu'''
|house older.sibling:MUT-1SG.GEN
|'my brother's house'
|c1 = (southern dialect; unmutated: ''ka'a''){{sfn|Brown|2001|p=348}}}}

*following certain prepositions
*as the S argument in nominalized intransitive clauses
*as the A argument in nominalized transitive clauses
*as the A argument in relative clauses with the P argument of a transitive verb as head
