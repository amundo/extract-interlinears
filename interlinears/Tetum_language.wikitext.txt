'''Tetum''' ({{lang-pt|Tetum}} {{IPA-pt|ˈt̪et̪ũ|}},;<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Linguistics Student's Handbook |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> {{lang-tet|Tetun}} {{IPA-tet|ˈt̪et̪un̪|}}) is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken on the island of [[Timor]]. It is spoken in [[Belu Regency]] in [[Indonesia]]n [[West Timor]], and across the border in [[East Timor]], where it is one of the two [[official language]]s.

In real terms there are two main forms of Tetum as a language:

* '''Tetum Terik''', which is a more indigenous form of Tetum marked by different word choice, less foreign influence and other characteristics such as verb conjugation
* '''Tetum/n Prasa''' (''market'' Tetum from the word ''praça'' in Portuguese meaning ''town square'') or '''Tetum/n Dili''' (given its widespread usage in the capital Dili). This is the form of Tetum (heavily influenced by Portuguese) that developed in Dili during colonial rule as local Tetum speakers came into contact with Portuguese missionaries, traders and colonial rulers. In East Timor ''Tetun Dili'' is widely spoken fluently as a second language.

Without previous contact, ''Tetum Terik'' and ''Tetun Dili'' are not immediately mutually intelligible, mainly because of the large number of Portuguese origin words used in Tetun Dili.<ref name="e16">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/tet|title=Tetun|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> Besides some grammatical simplification, Tetun Dili has been greatly influenced by the vocabulary and to a small extent by the grammar of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the other official language of East Timor.

==Nomenclature==
The English form "Tetum" is derived from Portuguese, rather than from modern Tetum. Consequently, some people regard "Tetun" as more appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tetum/contributors/cliffMorris-xhtml/index.html|title=A Traveller's Dictionary in Tetun-English and English-Tetun|website=www.gnu.org|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> Although this coincides with the favoured Indonesian form, and the variant with "m" has a longer history in English, "Tetun" has also been used by some Portuguese-educated Timorese, such as [[José Ramos-Horta]] and [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]].

Similar disagreements over nomenclature have emerged regarding the names of other languages, such as [[Swahili language|Swahili/Kiswahili]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi/Panjabi]].

==History and dialects==
[[File:Timor Sprache en.png|thumb|Languages of [[Timor Island]]. Tetum is in yellow.]]

According to linguist Geoffrey Hull, Tetum has four dialects:<ref name="Manhitu">{{Cite book |last=Manhitu |first=Yohanes |date=2016 |title=Tetum, A Language For Everyone: Tetun, Lian Ida Ba Ema Hotu-Hotu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uS3GDQAAQBAJ&pg=PR7 |location=New York |publisher=Mondial |page=vii-viii |isbn=9781595693211 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>

*''Tetun-Dili'', or ''Tetun-Prasa'' (literally "city Tetum"), is spoken in the capital, [[Dili]], and its surroundings, in the north of the country. Because of its simpler grammar than other varieties of Tetun, extensive Portuguese loanwords, and supposed creole-like features, ''Ethnologue'' and some researchers classify it as a Tetun-based [[creole language|creole]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/1997%20Grimes%20etal%20Nusa%20Teng%20Guide.pdf |title=A Guide to the People and Languages of Nusa Tenggara |last1=Grimes |first1=Charles E. |last2=Tom Therik |last3=Grimes |first3=Barbara Dix |last4=Max Jacob |publisher=Artha Wacana Press |year=1997 |location=Kupang |pages=52}}</ref><ref>Hull 2004</ref> This position, however, is also disputed in that while Tetun-Dili may exhibit simpler grammar, this does not mean that Tetun-Dili is a creole.{{refn|Catharina Williams-van Klinken states otherwise,<ref>Catharina Williams-van Klinken, 2011 (2nd ed.), ''Tetun Language Course'', Peace Corps East Timor, 2nd ed. 2011, footnote, p.58</ref>}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Chen |first=Yen-Ling |title=Tetun Dili And Creoles: Another Look |date=2015 |url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/wp-Yen-ling.pdf |work=Working Papers in Linguistics |volume=46 |issue=7 |publisher=University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa}}</ref> According to ''Ethnologue'', there were 50,000 Tetun-Dili speakers in East Timor in 2004.<ref name="Manhitu"/>
*''Tetun-Terik'' is spoken in the south and southwestern coastal regions. According to ''Ethnologue'', there were 50,000 Tetun-Terik speakers in East Timor in 1995.<ref name="Manhitu"/>
*''Tetun-Belu'', or the Belunese dialect, is spoken in a central strip of the island of Timor from the [[Ombai Strait]] to the [[Timor Sea]], and is split between [[East Timor]] and [[West Timor]], where it is considered a ''bahasa daerah'' or "regional language", with no official status in [[Indonesia]], although it is used by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Atambua|Diocese]] of [[Atambua]] in Roman Catholic rites.
*The ''Nana'ek'' dialect is spoken in the village of [[Metinaro]], on the coastal road between Dili and [[Manatuto]].

''Tetun-Belu'' and ''Tetun-Terik'' are not spoken outside their home territories. ''Tetun-Prasa'' is the form of Tetum that is spoken throughout East Timor. Although Portuguese was the official language of [[Portuguese Timor]] until 1975, ''Tetun-Prasa'' has always been the predominant ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the eastern part of the island.

In the fifteenth century, before the arrival of the Portuguese, Tetum had spread through central and eastern Timor as a [[contact language]] under the aegis of the Belunese-speaking [[Wehali|Kingdom of Wehali]], at that time the most powerful kingdom in the island. The Portuguese (present in Timor from c. 1556) made most of their settlements in the west, where [[Atoni|Dawan]] was spoken, and it was not until 1769, when the capital was moved from Lifau ([[Oecusse District|Oecussi]]) to Dili that they began to promote Tetum as an inter-regional language in their colony. Timor was one of the few Portuguese colonies where a local language, and not a form of Portuguese, became the [[lingua franca]]: this is because Portuguese rule was indirect rather than direct, the Europeans governing through local kings who embraced Catholicism and became vassals of the [[King of Portugal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianlang.mq.edu.au/INL/langs.html |title=The Languages of East Timor: Some Basic Facts |last=Hull |first=Geoffrey |date=24 August 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119191225/http://www.asianlang.mq.edu.au/INL/langs.html |archive-date=2008-01-19}}</ref>

When [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesia occupied East Timor]] between 1975 and 1999, declaring it "the Republic's 27th Province", the use of Portuguese was banned, and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] was declared the sole official language, but the [[Roman Catholic Church]] adopted Tetum as its liturgical language, making it a focus for cultural and national identity.<ref>[http://geo.ya.com/travelimages/timor/languages.html "Tetum and Other Languages of East Timor"],  from Dr. Geoffrey Hull's Preface to ''Mai Kolia Tetun: A Course in Tetum-Praca (The Lingua Franca of East Timor)''</ref> After the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET) took over governance in September 1999, Tetun (Dili) was proclaimed the country's official language, even though according to ''[[Encarta]] [[Winkler Prins]]'' it was only spoken by about 8% of the native population at the time, while the elite (consisting of 20 to 30 families) spoke Portuguese and most adolescents had been educated in Indonesian.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Oost-Timor. §1.5 Onafhankelijkheid". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref> When East Timor gained its independence on 20 May 2002, Tetum and Portuguese were declared as official languages. The 2010 census found that Tetum Prasa had 385,269 native speakers on a total population of 1,053,971, meaning that the share of native Tetum Prasa/Dili speakers had increased to 36.6% during the 2000s.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Table 13: Population distribution by mother tongue, Urban Rural and District|title=Volume 2: Population Distribution by Administrative Areas|url=http://www.mof.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Publication-2-English-Web.pdf|work=Population and Housing Census of Timor-Leste, 2010|publisher=Timor-Leste Ministry of Finance|page=205}}</ref>

In addition to regional varieties of Tetum in East Timor, there are variations in vocabulary and pronunciation, partly due to Portuguese and Indonesian influence. The Tetum spoken by East Timorese migrants in [[Portugal]] and [[Australia]] is more Portuguese-influenced, as many of those speakers were not educated in Indonesian.

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous===
The Tetum name for East Timor is ''Timór Lorosa'e'', which means "Timor of the rising sun", or, less poetically, "East Timor"; ''lorosa'e'' comes from ''loro'' "sun" and ''sa'e'' "to rise, to go up".  The noun for "word" is ''liafuan'', from ''lia'' "voice" and ''fuan'' "fruit". Some more words in Tetum:

===From Malay===
[[Image:Kursu portuges 5.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tetum (left) and Portuguese (right). From a Portuguese course for Tetum speakers. The text says: ''"Some people pronounce wrongly '*meja', '*uja' and '*abuja' instead of '[[wikt:mesa#Portuguese|mesa]]', '[[wikt:usa#Portuguese|usa]]' and '[[wikt:abusa#Portuguese|abusa]]'."'']]

As a result of [[Bazaar Malay]] being a regional lingua franca, many words are derived from [[Malay language|Malay]], including:

*''atus'' "hundred", from ''ratus''
*''barak'' "much", from ''banyak''
*''bele'' "can", from ''boleh''
*''besi'' "iron", from ''besi''
*''udan'' "rain", from ''hujan''
*''dalan'' "way" or "road", from ''jalan''
*''fatu(k)'' "stone", from ''batu''
*''fulan'' "moon" or "month" from ''bulan'' 
*''malae'' "foreigner", from ''melayu'' "Malay"
*''manas'' "hot", from ''panas''
*''rihun'' "thousand", from ''ribu''
*''sala'' "wrong", from ''salah''
*''tulun'' "help", from ''tolong''
*''dapur'' "kitchen", from ''dapur''
*''uma'' "house", from ''rumah''

In addition, as a legacy of [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule]], other words of Malay origin have entered  Tetum, through [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

===Numerals===
*''ida'' "one"
*''rua'' "two"
*''tolu'' "three"
*''haat'' "four"
*''lima'' "five"
*''neen'' "six"
*''hitu'' "seven"
*''ualu'' "eight"
*''sia'' "nine"
*''sanulu'' "ten"
*''ruanulu'' "twenty"

However, Tetum speakers often use [[Indonesian language|Malay/Indonesian]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] numbers instead, such as ''delapan'' or ''oito'' "eight" instead of ''ualu'', especially for numbers over one thousand.{{cn|date=March 2021}}

===Combinations===
Tetum has many hybrid words, which are [[Combining form|combinations]] of indigenous and Portuguese words. These often include an indigenous Tetum verb, with a Portuguese suffix ''-dór'' (similar to '-er'). For example:

* ''han'' ("to eat") ''handór'' – glutton.
* ''hemu'' ("to drink") ''hemudór'' – heavy drinker.
* ''hateten'' ("to say") ''hatetendór'' – chatterbox, talkative person.
* ''sisi'' ("to nag, pester") ''sisidór'' – nag, pest.

==Basic phrases==
*''Bondia'' – "Good morning"  (from  Portuguese ''Bom dia'').
*''Di'ak ka lae?'' – "How are you?" (literally "Are you well or not?")
*''Ha'u di'ak'' – "I'm fine."
*''Obrigadu/Obrigada'' – "Thank you", said by a male/female (from Portuguese ''Obrigado/Obrigada'').
*''Ita bele ko'alia Tetun?'' – "Do you speak Tetum?"
*''Loos'' – "Right"
*''Lae'' – "No."
*''Ha'u''' [''la''] ''komprende'' – "I [do not] understand" (from Portuguese ''compreender'').

==== Nouns and pronouns ====

===== Plural =====

The plural is not normally marked on nouns, but the word ''sira'' "they" can express it when necessary.

:''feto'' "woman/women" → ''feto sira'' "women"

However, the plural ending ''-s'' of nouns of Portuguese origin is sometimes retained.

:''Estadus Unidus'' – United States (from ''Estados Unidos'')
:''Nasoens Unidas'' – United Nations (from ''Nações Unidas'')

===== Definiteness =====

Tetum has an optional indefinite [[Article (grammar)|article]] ''ida'' ("one"), used after nouns:

:''labarik ida'' – a child

There is no definite article, but the [[demonstrative]]s ''ida-ne'e'' ("this one") and ''ida-ne'ebá'' ("that one") may be used to express definiteness:

:''labarik ida-ne'e'' – this child, the child
:''labarik ida-ne'ebá'' – that child, the child

In the plural, ''sira-ne'e'' ("these") or ''sira-ne'ebá'' ("those") are used:

:''labarik sira-ne'e'' – these children, the children
:''labarik sira-ne'ebá'' – those children, the children

===== Possessive/genitive =====

The particle ''nia'' forms the inalienable possessive, and can be used in a similar way to 's in English, e.g.:

:''João nia uma'' – João's house
:''Cristina nia livru'' – Cristina's book

When the possessor is postposed, representing alienable possession, ''nia'' becomes ''nian'':

:''povu Timór Lorosa'e nian'' – the people of East Timor

===== Inclusive and exclusive "we" =====

Like other Austronesian languages, Tetum has two forms of "we", ''ami'' (equivalent to Malay ''kami'') which is exclusive, e.g. "I and they", and ''ita'' (equivalent to Malay ''kita''), which is [[Clusivity|inclusive]], e.g. "you, I, and they".

:''ami-nia karreta'' – our [family's] car
:''ita-nia rain'' – our country

===== Nominalization =====

Nouns derived from verbs or adjectives are usually formed with [[affix]]es, for example the [[suffix]] ''-na'in'', similar to "-er" in English.

:''hakerek''  "write" → ''hakerek-na'in'' "writer"

The suffix ''-na'in'' can also be used with nouns, in the sense of "owner".

:''uma''  "house" → ''uma-na'in'' "householder"
In more traditional forms of Tetum,  the [[circumfix]] ''ma(k)- -k'' is used instead of ''-na'in''. For example, the nouns "sinner" or "wrongdoer" can be derived from the word ''sala'' as either ''maksalak'', or ''sala-na'in''. Only the [[prefix]] ''ma(k)-'' is used when the root word ends with a consonant; for example, the noun "cook" or "chef" can be derived from the word ''te'in'' as ''makte'in'' as well as ''te'in-na'in''.

The suffix ''-teen'' (from the word for "dirt" or "excrement") can be used with adjectives to form derogatory terms:

:''bosok'' "false" → ''bosok-teen'' "liar"

==== Adjectives ====

===== Derivation from nouns =====

To turn a noun into a nominalised adjective, the word ''oan'' (person, child, associated object) is added to it.

:''malae'' "foreigner" → ''malae-oan'' "foreign"

Thus, "Timorese person" is ''Timor-oan'', as opposed to the country of Timor, ''rai-Timor''.

To form adjectives and actor nouns from verbs, the suffix ''-dór'' (derived from Portuguese) can be added:

:''hateten'' "tell" → ''hatetendór'' "talkative"

===== Gender =====

Tetum does not have separate masculine and feminine gender, hence ''nia'' (similar to ''ia''/''dia''/''nya'' in Malay) can mean either "he", "she" or "it".

Different forms for the genders only occur in Portuguese-derived adjectives, hence ''obrigadu'' ("thank you") is used by men, and ''obrigada'' by women. The masculine and feminine forms of other adjectives derived from Portuguese are sometimes used with Portuguese loanwords, particularly by Portuguese-educated speakers of Tetum.

:''governu demokrátiku'' – democratic government (from ''governo democrático'', masculine)
:''nasaun demokrátika'' – democratic nation (from ''nação democrática'', feminine)

In some instances, the different gender forms have distinct translations into English:

:''bonitu'' – handsome
:''bonita'' – pretty

In indigenous Tetum words, the suffixes ''-mane'' ("male") and ''-feto'' ("female") are sometimes used to differentiate between the genders:

:''oan-mane'' "son" → ''oan-feto'' "daughter"

===== Comparatives and superlatives =====

Superlatives can be formed from adjectives by [[reduplication]]:

:''barak'' "much", "many" → ''babarak'' "very much", "many"
:''boot'' "big", "great" → ''boboot'' "huge", "enormous"
:''di'ak'' "good" → ''didi'ak'' "very good"
:''ikus'' "last" → ''ikuikus'' "the very last", "final"
:''moos'' "clean", "clear" → ''momoos'' "spotless", "immaculate"

When making comparisons, the word ''liu'' ("more") is used after the adjective, optionally followed by ''duké'' ("than" from Portuguese ''do que''):

:''Maria tuan liu (duké) Ana'' — Maria is older than Ana.

To describe something as the most or least, the word ''hotu'' ("all") is added:

:''Maria tuan liu hotu'' — Maria is the oldest.

==== Adverbs ====

Adverbs can be formed from adjectives or nouns by reduplication:

:''di'ak'' "good" → ''didi'ak'' "well"
:''foun'' "new", "recent" → ''foufoun'' "newly", "recently"
:''kalan'' "night" → ''kalakalan'' "nightly"
:''lais'' "quick" → ''lailais'' "quickly"
:''loron'' "day" → ''loroloron'' "daily"

==== Prepositions and circumpositions ====

The most commonly used [[preposition]]s in Tetum are the verbs ''iha'' ("have", "possess", "specific locative") and ''baa''/''ba'' ("go", "to", "for"). Most prepostional concepts of English are expressed by nominal phrases formed by using ''iha'', the object and the position (expressed by a noun),optionally with the possessive ''nia''.

:iha uma (nia) ''laran'' — ''inside'' the house
:iha foho (nia) ''tutun'' — ''on top of'' the mountain
:iha meza ''leten'' — ''on'' the table
:iha kadeira ''okos'' — ''under'' the chair
:iha rai ''li'ur'' — ''outside'' the country
:iha ema (nia) ''leet'' — ''between'' the people

==== Verbs ====

===== Copula and negation =====

There is no [[Copula (linguistics)|verb "to be"]] as such, but the word ''la'ós'', which translates as "not to be", is used for negation:

:''Timor-oan sira la'ós Indonézia-oan.'' — The Timorese are not Indonesians.

The word ''maka'', which roughly translates as "who is" or "what is", can be used with an adjective for emphasis:

:''João maka gosta serveja.'' — It's John who likes beer.

===== Interrogation =====

The [[Grammatical polarity|interrogative]] is formed by using the words ''ka'' ("or") or ''ka lae'' ("or not").

:''O bulak ka?'' — Are you crazy?
:''O gosta ha'u ka lae?'' — Do you like me?

===== Derivation from nouns and adjectives =====

[[Transitive verb]]s are formed by adding the prefix ''ha-'' or ''hak-'' to a noun or adjective:

:''been'' "liquid" → ''habeen'' "to liquify", "to melt"
:''bulak'' "mad" → ''habulak'' "to drive mad"
:''klibur'' "union" → ''haklibur'' "to unite"
:''mahon'' "shade" → ''hamahon'' "to shade", "to cover"
:''manas'' "hot" → ''hamanas'' "to heat up"

[[Intransitive verb]]s are formed by adding the prefix ''na-'' or ''nak-'' to a noun or adjective:

:''nabeen'' — (to be) liquified, melted
:''nabulak'' — (to be) driven mad
:''naklibur'' — (to be) united
:''namahon'' — (to be) shaded, covered
:''namanas'' — (to become) heated up

===== Conjugations and [[inflection]]s (in Tetun-Terik) =====

In ''Tetun-Terik'', verbs inflect when they begin with a vowel or consonant h. In this case [[consonant mutation|mutation]] of the first consonant occurs. For example, the verb ''haree'' (to see) in ''Tetun-Terik'' would be [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] as follows:

:''ha'u '''k'''aree'' —  I see
:''ó  '''m'''aree'' — you (sing.) see
:''nia '''n'''aree'' — he/she/it sees
:''ami '''h'''aree'' — we see
:''imi '''h'''aree'' — you (pl.) see
:''sira '''r'''aree'' — they see

=== Tenses  ===

==== Past  ====

Whenever possible, the past tense is simply inferred from the context, for example:

:''Horisehik ha'u han etu '' – Yesterday I ate rice.

However, it can be expressed by placing the adverb ''ona'' ("already") at the end of a sentence.

:''Ha'u han etu ona'' – I've (already) eaten rice.

When ''ona'' is used with ''la'' ("not") this means "no more" or "no longer", rather than "have not":

:''Ha'u la han etu ona'' – I don't eat rice anymore.

In order to convey that an action has not occurred, the word ''seidauk'' ("not yet") is used:

:''Ha'u seidauk han etu'' – I haven't eaten rice (yet).

When relating an action that occurred in the past, the word ''tiha'' ("finally" or "well and truly") is used with the verb.

:''Ha'u han tiha etu'' – I ate rice.

==== Future ====

The [[future tense]] is formed by placing the word ''sei'' ("will") before a verb:

:''Ha'u'' sei ''fó hahán ba sira'' – I ''will'' give them food.

The negative is formed by adding ''la'' ("not") between ''sei'' and the verb:

:''Ha'u'' sei la ''fó hahán ba sira'' – I ''will not'' give them food.

=== Aspects ===

==== Perfect ====

The perfect [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] can be formed by using ''tiha ona''.

:''Ha'u han etu tiha ona'' – I have eaten rice / I ate rice.

When negated, ''tiha ona'' indicates that an action ceased to occur:

:''Ha'u la han etu tiha ona'' – I didn't eat rice anymore.

In order to convey that a past action had not or never occurred, the word ''ladauk'' ("not yet" or "never") is used:

:''Ha'u ladauk han etu'' – I didn't eat rice / I hadn't eaten rice.

==== Progressive ====

The [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] can be obtained by placing the word ''hela'' ("stay") after a verb:

:''Sira serbisu hela.'' – They're (still) working.

=== Imperative ===

The [[imperative mood]] is formed using the word ''ba'' ("go") at the end of a sentence, hence:

:''Lee surat ba!'' – Read the letter!

The word ''lai'' ("just" or "a bit") may also be used when making  a request rather than a command:

:''Lee surat lai'' – Just read the letter.

When forbidding an action ''labele'' ("cannot") or ''keta'' ("do not") are used:

:''Labele fuma iha ne'e!'' – Don't smoke here!
:''Keta oho sira!'' – Don't kill them!

==Orthography and phonology==
{{See also|Tetum alphabet}}
The influence of Portuguese and to a lesser extent Malay/Indonesian on the phonology of Tetun has been extensive.

In the Tetum language, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} tend to have relatively fixed sounds. However {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} vary according to the environment they are placed in, for instance the sound is slightly higher if the proceeding syllable is {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>Hull, Geoffrey.

All consonants appearing in parenthesis are used only in loanwords.

Stops: All stops in Tetum are un-aspirated, meaning an expulsion of breath is absent. In contrast, English stops namely ‘p’ ‘t’ and ‘k’ are generally aspirated. 
 
Fricatives: 
{{IPA|/v/}} is an unstable voiced labio-dental fricative and tends to alternate with or is replaced by {{IPA|/b/}}; e.g. {{IPA|[aˈvoː]}} – {{IPA|[aˈboː]}} meaning ''grandparent.''<ref name="Williams-van Klinken 2002" />

As Tetum did not have any official recognition or support under either Portuguese or Indonesian rule, it is only recently that a standardised orthography has been established by the [[National Institute of Linguistics, Timor|National Institute of Linguistics]] (INL). The standard orthography devised by the institute was declared official by Government Decree 1/2004 of 14 April 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mj.gov.tl/jornal/public/docs/2002_2005/decreto_governo/1_2004.pdf |title=Governo Decreto no. 1/2004 de 14 de Abril "O Padrão Ortográfico da Língua Tétum"}}</ref> However, there are still widespread variations in spelling, one example being the word ''bainhira'' or "when", which has also been written as ''bain-hira'', ''wainhira'', ''waihira'', ''uaihira''. The use of "w"  or "u" is a reflection of the pronunciation in some rural dialects of ''Tetun-Terik''.

The current orthography originates from the spelling reforms undertaken by [[Fretilin]] in 1974, when it launched literacy campaigns across East Timor, and also from the system used by the Catholic Church when it adopted Tetum as its liturgical language during the Indonesian occupation. These involved the [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of many Portuguese words that were formerly written in their original spelling, for example, ''educação'' → ''edukasaun'' "education", and ''colonialismo'' → ''kolonializmu'' "colonialism".

Reforms suggested by the International Committee for the Development of East Timorese Languages (IACDETL) in 1996 included the replacement of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] "[[nh (digraph)|nh]]" and "[[lh (digraph)|lh]]" (borrowed from Portuguese, where they stand for the phonemes {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}}) by "n̄" and "l̄" , respectively (as in certain [[Basque language|Basque]] orthographies), to avoid confusion with the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/nh/}} and {{IPA|/lh/}}, which also occur in Tetum. Thus,  ''senhor'' "sir" became ''sen̄ór'', and ''trabalhador'' "worker" became ''trabal̄adór''. Later, as adopted by IACDETL and approved by the INL in 2002, "n̄" and "l̄" were replaced by "[[ñ]]" and "[[ll]]" (as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Thus,  ''sen̄ór'' "sir" became ''señór'', and ''trabal̄adór'' "worker" became ''traballadór''. Some linguists favoured using "[[ny (digraph)|ny]]" (as in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]]) and "[[ly (digraph)|ly]]" for these sounds, but the latter spellings were rejected for being similar to the Indonesian system, and most speakers actually pronounce ''ñ'' and ''ll'' as {{IPA|[i̯n]}}  and {{IPA|[i̯l]}}, respectively, with a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[i̯]}} which forms a [[diphthong]] with the preceding vowel (but reduced to {{IPA|[n]}}, {{IPA|[l]}} after {{IPA|/i/}}), not as the [[palatal consonant]]s of Portuguese and Spanish. Thus, ''señór'', ''traballadór'' are pronounced {{IPA|[sei̯ˈnoɾ]}}, {{IPA|[tɾabai̯laˈdoɾ]}}, and ''liña'', ''kartilla'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈlina]}}, {{IPA|[kaɾˈtila]}}. As a result, some writers use "in" and "il" instead, for example ''Juinu'' and ''Juilu'' for June and July (''Junho'' and ''Julho'' in Portuguese).

As well as variations in the transliteration of Portuguese loanwords, there are also variations in the spelling of indigenous words. These include the use of double vowels and the [[apostrophe]] for the [[glottal stop]], for example ''boot'' → ''bot'' "large" and ''ki'ik'' →  ''kiik'' "small".

The sound {{IPA|[z]}}, which is not indigenous to Tetum but appears in many loanwords from Portuguese and Malay, often changed to {{IPA|[s]}} in old Tetum and to {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (written "j") in the speech of young speakers: for example, ''meja'' "table" from Portuguese ''mesa'', and ''kamija'' "shirt" from Portuguese ''camisa''.  In the sociolect of Tetum that is still used by the generation educated during the Indonesian occupation, {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} may occur in [[free variation]]. For instance, the Portuguese-derived word ''ezemplu'' "example" is pronounced {{IPA|[eˈʒemplu]}} by some speakers, and conversely ''Janeiru'' "January" is pronounced {{IPA|[zanˈeiru]}}. The sound {{IPA|[v]}}, also not native to the language, often shifted to {{IPA|[b]}}, as in ''serbisu'' "work" from Portuguese ''serviço'' (also note that a modern INL convention promotes the use of ''serbisu'' for "work" and ''servisu'' for "service").
