'''Orok''' (also '''Ulta''' ульта, or ''Uilta'', ''Ujlta'' уйльта<ref>''Uilta'' may come from the word ''ulaa'' which means 'domestic reindeer'. Tsumagari, Toshiro, 2009: "Grammatical Outline of Uilta (Revised)". Hokkaido University</ref>) is a language of the [[Tungusic languages|Manchu-Tungus family]] spoken in the [[Poronaysky District|Poronaysky]] and [[Nogliksky District|Nogliksky]] [[administrative divisions of Sakhalin Oblast|Administrative Divisions]] of [[Sakhalin Oblast]], in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], by the small nomadic group known as the [[Orok people|Orok or Ulta]]. The designation of Uilta may be related to the word ulaa which translates to ‘domestic reindeer’. The northern Uilta who live along the river of Tym’ and around the village of Val have reindeer herding as one of their traditional occupations. The group of southern Uilta live along the Polonay down the near city of [[Polonask]]. The two dialects come from northern and eastern groups, however having very few differences. Some of the language contacts are [[Evenki language|Evenki]], [[Nivkh languages|Nivkh]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

==Classification==
Orok is closely related to [[Nanai language|Nanai]], and is classified within the southern branch of the [[Tungusic languages|Manchu-Tungus]] languages. Classifications which recognize an intermediate group between the northern and southern branch of [[Tungusic languages|Manchu-Tungus]] classify Orok (and [[Nanai language|Nanai]]) as Central Tungusic. Within Central Tungusic, [[Glottolog]] groups Orok with [[Ulch language|Ulch]] as "Ulchaic", and Ulchaic with Nanai as "Central-Western Tungusic" (also known{{by whom|date=June 2019}} as the "Nanai group"), while [[Oroch language|Oroch]], [[Kilen language|Kilen]] and [[Udihe language|Udihe]] are grouped as "Central-Eastern Tungusic".<ref name="glot">{{cite web| editor-last1= Hammarström| editor-first1 = Harald| editor-last2 = Forke| editor-first2 = Robert| editor-last3 = Haspelmath| editor-first3 = Martin| editor-last4 = Bank| editor-first4 = Sebastian| year = 2020|title = Orok | work = [[Glottolog]] 4.3| url = https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/orok1265}}</ref>

==Distribution==
Although there has been an increase in the total population of the [[Oroks|Uilta]] there has been a decrease in persons who speak Ulta as their mother tongue. The total population of Ulta was at 200 in the 1989 census of which 44.7, then increased to approximately 300-400 persons. However, the number of native speakers decreased to 25-16 persons.  According to the results of the Russian population census of 2002, Ulta (Orok) (all who identified themselves as "Oroch with Ulta language", "Orochon with Ulta language", "Uilta", "Ulta", "Ulch with Ulta language" were attributed to Ulta) count 346 people, 201 of them – urban and 145 – village dwellers. The percentage of 18.5%, which is 64 persons pointed that they have a command of their ("Ulta")language, which, mostly, should be considered as a result of increased national consciousness in the post-Soviet period than a reflection of the real situation. In fact, the number of those people with a different degree of command of the Ulta language is less than 10 and the native language of the population is overwhelmingly Russian. Therefore because of the lack of a practical writing system and sufficient official support the Orok language has become an endangered language.

The language is critically endangered or moribund. According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]] there were 346 Oroks living in the north-eastern part of Sakhalin, of whom 64 were competent in Orok. By the 2010 census, that number had dropped to 47. Oroks also live on the island of [[Hokkaido]] in Japan, but the number of speakers is uncertain, and certainly small.<ref>Novikova, 1997</ref> Yamada (2010) reports 10 active speakers, 16 conditionally bilingual speakers, and 24 passive speakers who can understand with the help of Russian. The article states that "It is highly probable that the number has since decreased further."<ref>{{harvp|Yamada|2010|page=70}}</ref>

Orok is divided into two dialects, listed as Poronaisk (southern) and Val-Nogliki (northern).<ref name="glot" /> The few Orok speakers in Hokkaido speak the southern dialect. "The distribution of Uilta is closely connected with their half-nomadic lifestyle, which involves reindeer herding as a subsistence economy."<ref>{{harvp|Yamada|2010|page=60}}</ref> The Southern Orok people stay in the coastal [[Okhotsk]] area in the Spring and Summer, and move to the North Sakhalin plains and East Sakhalin mountains during the Fall and Winter. The Northern Orok people live near the [[Terpenija Bay]] and the [[Poronai River]] during spring and summer, and migrate to the East Sakhalin mountains for autumn and winter.

== Research ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2021}}
[[Takeshiro Matsuura]] (1818-1888), a prominent Japanese explorer of Hokkaido, southern Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands, was the first to make a notable record of the language. Matsuura wrote down about 350 Uilta words in Japanese, including about 200 words with grammatical remarks and short texts. The oldest set of known record{{clarify|date=October 2021}} of the Uilta language is a 369-entry collection of words and short sample sentences under the title "Worokkongo", dating from the mid-nineteen century.{{cn|date=October 2021}} Japanese researcher [[Akira Nakanome]], during the Japanese possession of South Sakhalin, researched the Uilta language and published a small grammar with a glossary of 1000 words. Other researchers who published some work on the Uilta were [[Hisharu Magata]], [[Hideya Kawamura]], T.I Petrova, A.I Novikova, L.I Sem, and contemporary specialist L.V. Ozolinga. Magata published a substantial volume of dictionaries called "A Dictionary of the Uilta Language / Uirutago Jiten" in 1981. Others contributing to Uilta scholarship were Ozolinga, who published two substantial dictionaries: one in 2001 with 1200 words, and one in 2003 with 5000 Uilta-Russian entries and 400 Russian-Uilta entries.

==Orthography==
An alphabetic script, based on [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], was introduced in 2007. A primer has been published, and the language is taught in one school on the island of [[Sakhalin]].<ref>Уилтадаирису (in Russian; retrieved 2011-08-17) ({{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://uztranslations.net.ru/?category=tungusbooks-tungusic&altname=uiltadairisu_hovorim_po-uiltinski |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826124733/http://uztranslations.net.ru/?category=tungusbooks-tungusic&altname=uiltadairisu_hovorim_po-uiltinski |archive-date=26 August 2014 |access-date=2014-12-01}})</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2021}} <!-- Аа А̄а̄ Бб Вв Гг Дд Ее Е̄е̄ Зз Ии Ӣӣ Јј Кк Лл Мм Нн Н?н?

In 2008, the first Uilta primer was published, which established a writing system.<ref name="Toshiro 2009">{{Cite journal |last=Tsumagari |first=Toshiro |date=2009 |title=Grammatical Outline of Uilta (Revised) |journal=Journal of the Graduate School of Letters |language=en |volume=4 |pages=1–21 |hdl-access=free |hdl=2115/37062}}</ref>

== Morphology ==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Data and examples are not properly integrated into the text. Table is not properly formatted.|date=October 2021}}
The Orok language is formed by elements called actor nouns.{{clarify|date=October 2021}} These actor nouns are formed when a present participle is combined with the noun - ɲɲee. In Orok, for example, the element - ɲɲee (< *ɲia), has become a general suffix for 'humans', as in ǝǝktǝ-ɲɲee ‛woman’, geeda-ɲɲee ‛one person’ and xasu-ɲɲee ‛how many people?’. Much of what constitutes Orok and its forms{{clarify|date=October 2021}} can be traced back to the [[Ulch language]].{{dubious|date=October 2021}} It is from there that the more peculiar features of Orok have its origins.{{dubious|date=October 2021}}{{clarify|date=October 2021}}

Orok has participial markers for three tenses: past -{{transl|oaa|xa(n-)}}, present +ri, and future -li. When the participle of an uncompleted action, +ri, is combined with the suffix -la, it creates the future tense marker +rila-. It also has the voluntative marker (‘let us…!’) +risu, in which the element -su diachronically represents the 2nd person plural ending. Further forms were developed that were based on +ri: the subjunctive in +{{transl|oaa|rila-xa(n-)}} (fut-ptcp.pst-), the 1st person singular optative in +ri-tta, the 3rd person imperative in +ri-llo (+ri-lo), and the probabilitative{{clarify|date=October 2021}} in +ri-li- (ptcp.prs-fut).

In possessive forms, if the possessor is human, the suffix -ɲu is always added following the noun stem.{{cn|date=October 2021}} The suffix -ɲu indicates that the referent is an indirect or an alienable possessee. To indicate direct and inalienable possession, the suffix -ɲu is omitted. For example, 
* ulisep -ɲu- bi 'my meat' vs. ulise-bi 'my flesh'
* böyö -ɲu- bi 'my bear' vs. ɲinda-bi 'my dog'
* sura - ɲu - bi 'my flea' vs. cikte-bi 'my louse'
* kupe - ɲu - bi 'my thread' vs. kitaam-bi 'my needle'

Pronouns are divided into four groups: personal, reflexive, demonstrative, and interrogative. Orok personal pronouns have three persons (first, second, and third) and two numbers (singular and plural).

1st 	bii – buu
2nd 	sii – suu
3rd 	nooni – {{transl|oaa|nooci}}.

== Syllables and moras ==
[[Syllable|Syllable structure]] can be represented as CVVC.{{cn|date=October 2021}} Any consonant may be the syllable{{clarify|date=October 2021}} at the beginning of a word (syllable-initial) or the very last syllable (syllable-final).{{cn|date=October 2021}} Furthermore, syllables in this case{{clarify|date=October 2021}} can be divided into [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]], or rhythmic units, which determine stress and timing of the word and can be ranked as primary or secondary.<ref name="Toshiro 2009" /> Any word typically contains a minimum of two moras, and monosyllabic words will always have VV.<ref name="Toshiro 2009" /> Therefore, in any case there are no words with the structure of CVC.{{page needed|date=October 2021}}

== Syntax ==
Noun phrases have the following order: determiner, adjective, noun.

<section begin="list-of-glossing-abbreviations"/><div style="display:none;">
N:noun
S:subject
O:object
V:verb
</div><section end="list-of-glossing-abbreviations"/>
{{interlinear|number=ex:

|Eri goropci nari
|DET ADJ N
|‘This old man.’}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Arisal goropci nari-l
|DET ADJ N
|‘Those old men’.}}

Subjects precede verbs:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Bii xalacci-wi
|S   V
|‘I will wait’.}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|{ii bii} ŋennɛɛ-wi
|S        V
|‘Yes, I will go’.}}

With an object the order is [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Sii gumasikkas nu-la
|S   O          V
|‘You have money’.}}

Adjectives go after their noun:

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|tari {nari caa} ninda-ji kusalji tuksɛɛ-ni
|DET  S          N        ADJ     V
|‘That man runs faster than that dog’.}}

A sentence where the complement comes after its complement is a postposition:{{what|date=October 2021}}

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|Sundattaa dug-ji bii-ni
|N         N      Post
|‘The fish (sundattaa) is at home (dug-ji)’.}}
