=== Complex Sentences ===
Complex sentences in Zabana are formed when a conjoined clause is used in a sentence, by using one of the three different connectors: ''nia'', ''ga'', and ''ba'' which are "and", "or", and "but" respectively. The exception of this rule is the connecting particle ''ghe'' which is used to denote a conditional sentence or question and ''nia'' must be used to connect the pronoun and the proper noun together. ''ghe'' can also be used in a complex sentence to link together two different proper nouns.<ref name=":1" />

=== Conditional Sentence ===
In Zabana there are two different types of conditional sentences: simple and counterfactual sentences. Both sentences use the particle ''la'' to denote that they are conditional sentences.<ref name=":1" />
* Simple Conditional: Denoted by the use of the particle ''to'' along with the particle ''la'', simple conditional sentences state a hypothetical situation in Zabana.<ref name=":1" /> <blockquote>
Example: To nanarela ghatu e kotoro hofi ini
"If it rains today, the roof will leak."

* Counterfactual: States a situation where the condition is no fulfilled.<ref name=":1" /><blockquote>
Example: Geke meha la ia vaka norao gela to lao ara kia
"If the boat had come yesterday, I would have gone to Kia."
