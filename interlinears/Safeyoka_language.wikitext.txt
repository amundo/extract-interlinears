=== Series ===
The '''series sentence''' indicates multiple actions a person does. There is no grammatical distinction between temporal succession and temporal overlap. Usually used to explain actions which are performed by a dual or plural subject. However, actions with this partial change in subject may also be classified as a sequence sentence.<ref name=":3" />

=== Sequence ===
The '''sequence sentence''' indicates an order of actions being completed by a subject, where base 1 differs from base 2. The action of the first base is usually completed before the action of the second base even begins. The deep structure of this sentence type is that it is purely based on succession.<ref name=":3" />

Example:

"''S[[ɨ]]<nowiki/>kuno nomeHON[[Ɨ]]NGKI sukwo'miyomo hofantiso toho nelofAHON[[Ɨ]]NGKI"''

This translates into "Darkness came and night mosquitoes bit us". This expresses temporal succession.<ref name=":3" />

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
The Wojokeso has fifteen simple and six complex consonant phonemes. The points of articulation include bilabial, alveolar, alveopalatal and velar. The bilabial fricative phoneme is /p/, alveolar resonant phoneme /I/, alveopalatal stop phoneme /j/ and velar fricative phoneme /h/.<ref name=":3" />

=== Vowels ===
The Wojokeso contains five vowel phonemes, /i, u, e, [[Turned v|ʌ]], a/. However, there was said to be seven vowels of the Wojokeso /i, e, [[æ]]''',''' [[ɨ]]''',''' [[Turned v|ʌ]], a, u/ although there were no clear cut contrasts.<ref name=":3" />

==== Vowel Clusters ====
When two vowels occur contiguously, they are considered separate segments. Non-suspect sequences such as /ea/, /ae/, occur and sequences /ai/, /ia/ and /[[Turned v|ʌ]]<nowiki/>u/, /u[[Turned v|ʌ]]/. The syllabic and pitch accent of these vowels consider the syllables to be separate. In the words of /hasamj[[Turned v|ʌ]]<nowiki/>hw[[Turned v|ʌ]]/ ~ /hasa[[Glottal stop|ʔ]]<nowiki/>emj[[Turned v|ʌ]]<nowiki/>hw[[Turned v|ʌ]]/ 'dragonfly'. /[[Glottal stop|ʔ]]/ is optional between two vowels.<ref name=":3" />
