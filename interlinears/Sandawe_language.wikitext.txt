'''Sandawe''' is a language spoken by about 60,000 [[Sandawe people]] in the [[Dodoma Region]] of [[Tanzania]]. Sandawe's use of [[click consonants]], a rare feature shared with only two other language of East Africa – [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Dahalo]], had been the basis of its classification as a member of the defunct [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan family]] of Southern Africa since Albert Drexel in the 1920s. Recent investigations however (Güldemann 2010) suggest that Sandawe may be related to the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]] regardless of the validity of Khoisan as a whole. A discussion of Sandawe's linguistic classification can be found in Sands (1998).

Language use is vigorous among both adults and children, with people in some areas monolingual. Sandawe has two dialects, northwest and southeast. Differences include speaking speed, vowel dropping, some [[word taboo]], and minor lexical and grammatical differences. Some [[Alagwa people|Alagwa]] have shifted to Sandawe, and are considered a Sandawe clan.

[[SIL International]] began work on Sandawe in 1996 and to date (2004), Daniel and Elisabeth Hunziker and Helen Eaton continue to work on the analysis of the language. They have so far produced a phonological description, a dialect survey report and several papers on aspects of grammar. Sandawe is also currently (since 2002) studied by Sander Steeman of [[Leiden University]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
[[File:Sandawe vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|Sandawe vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Eaton|2006|p=237}}]]

Sandawe has five vowel qualities:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA link|i}}
| {{IPA link|u}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA link|e}}
| {{IPA link|o}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan=2 | {{IPA link|a}}
|}

All five vowel qualities may be found as short oral {{IPA|/a/}}, long oral {{IPA|/aː/}}, and long nasal {{IPA|/ãː/}} vowels {{Clarify|reason=current text gives impression that all five vowels can shift tot /a/; meant is probably to give examples only for /a/; please indicate with "e.g."|date=August 2014}}. There are therefore fifteen basic vowel phonemes. Short nasal vowels also occur, apparently from the historical elision of a nasal consonant that is still attested in related forms. Long vowels are written double, ''aa,'' and long nasal vowels with a tilde, ''ã.''

Long vowels are about 50% longer than short vowels. In morpheme-final position, low-tone /u/ and /i/ are frequently devoiced, though this may not occur after /j/, /w/, or /h/.

===Consonants===

====Non-click consonants====
The glyphs in {{angbr|brackets}} are the practical orthography developed by Hunziker and Hunziker, along with approximate equivalents in the IPA.

''Tc'' and ''dz'' are {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in the northwestern dialect, but often {{IPA|[ts]}} and {{IPA|[dz]}} or even {{IPA|[z]}} in the southeast. {{IPA|[tsʰ]}} for ''tch'' occurs but is less common.

The clicks in Sandawe are not particularly loud, when compared to better known click languages in southern Africa. The lateral click {{IPAblink|kǁ}} can be confused with the [[alveolar lateral ejective affricate]] {{IPAblink|tɬʼ}} even by native speakers. With the [[alveolar click|postalveolar clicks]], the tongue often slaps the bottom of the mouth, and this slap may be louder than the actual release of the click. Wright et al. transcribe this [[slapped click]] with the [[extended-IPA]] symbol {{angbr IPA|ǃ¡}}. The voiced clicks are uncommon, being found in a few words such as ''gqokomi'' 'greater kudu' and ''gcingco'' (sp. bird). Labialized clicks are found in word-initial position.

The glottalized click phonation is something like [[creaky voice]], not an [[ejective]]. In initial position, the [[glottis]] is closed during the entire occlusion of the click, and not opened until after the release burst. In medial position, the glottis is closed after the velar closure {{IPA|[ŋ]}} and before the forward closure, but opened ''before'' the click release. Such clicks are not nasalized all the way through; in some tokens they are simply prenasalized glottalized clicks, {{IPA|[ŋkǃˀ]}}, bearing in mind that the superscript {{angbr IPA|ˀ}} implies [[co-articulated consonant|coarticulation]] (that is, that it is pronounced together with the {{IPA|[k]}}, not after).

The practical orthography is based on [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

===Tone===
Hunziker et al. (2008) transcribe seven phonetic tones: high {{IPA|[á]}}, mid {{IPA|[ā]}}, low {{IPA|[à]}}, high falling {{IPA|[â]}}, mid falling {{IPA|[ā̀]}}, low falling {{IPA|[ȁ]}}, and rising {{IPA|[ǎː]}} (on long vowels only). In Sandawe orthography, they are written as exactly with their IPA spelling, but the rising tone is marked as ǎ.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sandawe language |url=https://omniglot.com/writing/sandawe.htm |website=Omniglot |access-date=13 October 2021}}</ref>

High and low tones are analyzed as the basic tone configurations. However, the high-falling tone is contrastive, for example in {{IPA|[tsʼâ]}} 'water', but it also occurs often due to a sequence of tones. The mid tone does not occur initially. Hunziker et al. analyze it as a [[downstep]]ped high tone: //H-L-H// is realized as [H-H-M]. This rightward shift on the tones is a general process in Sandawe.{{Clarify|reason=last H of H-L-H seems to have shifted leftward in H-H-M rather than rightward; M may be a transformed L and have shifted rightward, but this is by no means clear from the text|date=August 2014}} This analysis requires the assumption of [[floating tone|floating low tones]] carried by [[consonant cluster]]s, and thought to reflect a historical vowel which has been deleted. The low and mid falling{{Clarify|reason=low falling and mid falling or plain low and mid falling?|date=August 2014}} tones are a prosodic effect, found on final syllables, or on penultimate syllables followed by a voiceless vowel; this leftward shift of tone before voiceless vowels (which by their nature cannot carry tone) is another general process of Sandawe. Rising tone is only found on long vowels and can be analyzed as a low-high sequence.

Thus at a phonemic level, {{smallcaps|high}}, {{smallcaps|low}}, {{smallcaps|falling}}, and {{smallcaps|downstep}} are contrastive.

===Phonotactics===
The majority of Sandawe syllables are [[consonant|C]][[vowel|V]]. Morpheme-initially, consonant clusters are of the form Cw; these are not found in the middle of morphemes. Most consonants are attested in this Cw sequence apart from the labials, the glottals ''(ʼ, h),'' sonorants ''(r, l, y, w),'' and the rather infrequent consonants ''n, d, dl,'' & the voiced clicks, which may simply be gaps in attestation. The rounded vowels ''o, u'' are not found after Cw sequences. Vowel initial syllables, as in ''cèú'' 'buffalo', are not found initially, though initial glottal stop is not written (''íóó'' {{IPA|/ʔíóː/}} 'mother').

Glottal stops {{IPA|/ʔ/}} are found as syllable codas, though these may be released in an [[echo vowel]] in some circumstances. Hunziker et al. prefer to analyze these are final consonants, because the quality of the echo vowel is predictable, and otherwise this is the only place where the vowels /e a o/ would have voiceless allophones.

Hunziker et al. find complementary distribution between homorganic [[Nasal stop|N]]C clusters, which occur only medially (there are no word-final nasal consonants), and nasal vowels, which they only transcribe word finally. It would therefore seem that NC clusters are the realization of a preceding nasal vowel.

Other final consonants are found as consonant clusters in the middle of a word. Historically, these are presumably due to vowel elision, as evidenced by records from the early 20th century and also by tone patterns. In the northwestern dialect, words are found with final consonants where tonal patterns suggest there was once a voiceless final vowel, and where the southeastern dialect retains a voiceless ''i'' or ''u.''

===Syllable structure===
Sandawe syllables are usually of the form CV; in monosyllabic words, word-final nasals are not uncommon, CV(N). Sometimes other consonants are found in word-final position, but this is most probably the result of deletion of word-final voiceless vowels.

A syllabic nasal ''m'' is found in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] loanwords. The most common word structure is disyllabic with or without long vowels (CV(ː)CV(ː)), according to De Voogt (1992).

===Nouns===
Although nouns can be masculine or feminine, there is usually no particular marker that indicates the gender. Many singular feminine human nouns are marked by the ending -sù, whereas some singular masculine human nouns end in -é. Additionally, definite human feminine nouns must be marked with the suffix -sù, often repeating marking:

{{interlinear|indent=3|lang=sad
|ncûmsù-n-sù
|wife-DEF-F
|'the wife'}}

Gender assignment for most non-human animates as well as inanimates is largely unpredictable. However, according to Steeman (2011), all body parts are masculine, bigger plants are masculine while smaller plants are feminine, machinery nouns new to the Sandawe (whose names are typically borrowed from Swahili) are usually feminine, and deverbal nouns representing acts (nominalizations) are masculine. According to Eaton (2010), a masculine noun can be made a diminutive by treating it as a feminine noun.

According to Eaton (2010), definite plural nouns are marked with the suffix -khéé, while definite associative plurals are marked with the suffix -khì. According to Steeman (2011), definite human plurals are marked with -sò.

===Adjectives===
The same roots may be used as adjectives or verbs according to Kagaya (1993:ix).

===Syntax===
Basic word order in Sandawe is SOV according to De Voogt (1992). However, word order in the Sandawe sentence is very flexible due to the presence of several 'subject identification strategies'.

Sample sentence (mid tones are not marked):
{{interlinear|indent=3|lang = sad
|úte-s kxʼaré-és hàʔǃà
|yesterday-I boy-I called
|'Yesterday I called a boy.'<ref>Source: De Voogt 1992:19, adapted from Tucker 1977.</ref>}}

An article in Studies in African Linguistics, Volume 10, Number 3, 1979, by Gerard Dalgish, describes these 'subject identification strategies' in detail. Numerous permutations of sentence constituents are allowed in certain tenses, the pattern being: (a) the first constituent is the subject or (b) any non-subject that is first in the sentence must be marked for the subject. Non-subject constituents include verbs, a progressive marker, objects, indirect objects, adverbs, prepositional phrases, complementizers. Similar results are obtained in WH-Questions.

===Tone===
Elderkin (1989) analyzes Sandawe as having two level tones (High, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising). His thesis considers the behavior of tone at word-, sentence- and discourse-level. De Voogt (1992) and Kagaya (1993) list three level tones (High, Mid, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising).

==Classification==
[[File:KhoisanLanguagesModernDistribution.png|thumb|Map of the "Khoisan" languages; Sandawe is shaded olive.]]
The most promising candidate as a relative of Sandawe are the [[Khoe languages]] of [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]. Most of the putative cognates Greenberg (1976) gives as evidence for Sandawe being a Khoisan language in fact tie Sandawe to Khoe. Gueldemann and Elderkin have strengthened that connection, with several dozen likely cognates, while casting doubts on other Khoisan connections. Although there are not enough similarities to reconstruct a Proto-Khoe–Sandawe language, there are enough to suggest that the connection is real. However, other linguists have criticized the proposal as cherry-picking among a large number of non-matching pronominal forms.

The pronominal system is quite similar: 
{| class=wikitable
! 
! Sandawe
! Proto-Khoe–Kwadi
|-
! 1sg PN
| tsi
| *ti (Kwadi tʃi)
|-
! 2sg PN
| ha-
| *sa
|-
! 3 PN base
| he-
| xa (Kwadi ha-)
|-
! 3ms suffix
| -w(e), -m
| (Khoe *-bV, *-mV)
|-
! 3fs suffix 
| su
| (Khoe *-sV)
|}

These may cast some light on the development of clicks. For example, the Sandawe word for 'horn', ''tlana,'' may be a cognate with the root ''nǁâ'' found throughout the Khoe family. This and other words suggests that clicks may form from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word is lost: ''*tlana > *tlna > ǁna (nǁa).''

Another word common to Sandawe and Khoe, the numeral ''haka'' 'four', is also found in the neighboring Cushitic languages [[Aasax language|Aasax]] and [[Kwʼadza language|Kwʼadza]], and was perhaps borrowed into them from Sandawe.

Since the Khoe family appears to have migrated to southern Africa from the northeast,{{why|date=April 2021}} it may be that Sandawe is closer to their common homeland than the modern Khoe languages are.
