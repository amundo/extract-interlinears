'''Wolaitta'''<ref>Other transliterations include Wolaytta, Wolaita, and Wolayta or Welayta.</ref> is a [[North Omotic language]] of the [[Ometo languages|Ometo]] group spoken in the [[Wolayita Zone]] and some other parts of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. It is the native language of the [[Welayta people]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=wal|title=Wolaytta|website=Ethnologue.com|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref> The estimates of the population vary greatly because it is not agreed where the boundaries of the language are.

There are conflicting claims about how widely Wolaytta is spoken. Some hold that [[Melo language|Melo]], [[Oyda language|Oyda]], and [[Gamo-Gofa-Dawro language|Gamo-Gofa-Dawro]] are also dialects, but most authorities, including Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 now list these as separate languages. The different communities of speakers also recognize them as separate languages.<ref>Abebe 2002</ref> A variety called ''Laha'' is said to be 'close' to Wolaytta in Hayward (1990) but listed as a distinct language by Blench; however, it is not included in ''Ethnologue''.

{{anchor|writing}}Wolaytta has existed in written form since the 1940s, when the [[Sudan Interior Mission]] first devised a system for writing it. The writing system was later revised by a team led by Dr. Bruce Adams. They finished the New Testament in 1981 and the entire Bible in 2002. It was one of the first languages the [[Derg]] selected for their literacy campaign (1979–1991), before any other southern languages. Welaytta pride in their written language led to a fiercely hostile response in 1998 when the Ethiopian government distributed textbooks written in Wegagoda – an artificial language based on amalgamating Wolaytta with several closely related languages. As a result the textbooks in Wegagoda were withdrawn and teachers returned to ones in Wolaytta.<ref>Sarah Vaughan, [http://www.ihasa.org/documents/special-reports/ethnicity-in-ethiopia.pdf "Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813043308/http://www.ihasa.org/documents/special-reports/ethnicity-in-ethiopia.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (University of Edinburgh: Ph.D. Thesis, 2003), pp. 250-258</ref>

In speaking their language, the Wolaytta people use many proverbs. A large collection of them, in Ethiopian script, was published in 1987 ([[Ethiopian calendar]]){{efn-ua|1994/1995 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calendar-converter.com/ethiopian/|title=Ethiopian – Calendar Converter|website=www.calendar-converter.com|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref>}} by the Academy of Ethiopian Languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=846 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315035156/http://good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=846 |archive-date=2013-03-15 }}</ref> Fikre Alemayehu's 2012 MA thesis from [[Addis Ababa University]] provides an analysis of Wolaytta proverbs and their functions.<ref>{{cite web|title=An analysis of Wolayta proverbs: Function in focus|url=https://pdfslide.net/documents/an-analysis-of-wolayta-proverbs-by-fikre-alemayehu-2013.html|format=PDF|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>

==Language status==
The language is the official language in the [[Wolayita Zone]] of Ethiopia. The Ethnologue cites statistics that 5% to 25% of the population are literate in this language. Portions of the Bible were produced in 1934, the New Testament in 1981, and the entire Bible in 2002.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Wakasa (2008) gives the following consonant phonemes for Wolaytta. (He also has {{IPA|mˀ, nˀ, lˀ}}, but these are consonant clusters, {{angle bracket|m7, n7, l7}}.) Items in {{angle bracket|angle brackets}} show the Latin alphabet, where this differs from the IPA:

{| class="wikitable"

Two consonants require further discussion.  The sound written {{angle bracket|nh}} is described by Wakasa (2008:44) as a '[[nasalized glottal fricative]]'; it is said to be extremely rare, occurring in only one common noun, an interjection, and two proper names.  The status of the sound written {{angle bracket|D}} is apparently in dispute; Adams (1983:48) and Lamberti and Sottile (1997:23, 25-26) claim that it is implosive, thus presumably {{IPA|[ɗ&thinsp;]}}.  Wakasa (2008:62) denies that this consonant is implosive, and calls it 'glottalized'. (See [[implosive]] for more on such discrepancies.)

===Vowels===

Wolaytta has five vowels, which appear both long and short:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
![[Front vowel|Front]]
![[Central vowel|Central]]
![[Back vowel|Back]]
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[High vowel|High]]
|{{IPA|i}}, {{IPA|iː}} || || {{IPA|u}}, {{IPA|uː}}
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[Mid vowel|Mid]]
|{{IPA|e}}, {{IPA|eː}}|| || {{IPA|o}}, {{IPA|oː}}
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[Low vowel|Low]]
| || {{IPA|a}}, {{IPA|aː}} ||
|}

==Grammar==

===Word order===
Like other Omotic languages, the Wolaytta language has the basic word order SOV (subject–object–verb), as shown in the following example (Wakasa 2008:1041):

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|na7-ái 7iss-í maxááp-aa shamm-íis.
|child-NOM.M.SG. one-OBL. book-ABS.M.SG. buy-{{gcl|PF|perfect}}.3M.SG.
|"The boy bought a book."}}

It has postpositional phrases, which precede the verb (Wakasa 2008:1042):

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ta-7ish-ái maxááp-aa ba-lágg-iya-ppe tall7-íis.
|my-brother-NOM.M.SG. book-ABS.M.SG. his:own-friend-OBL.M.SG.-from borrow-{{gcl|PF|perfect}}.3M.SG.
|"My brother borrowed a book from his friend."}}

Nouns used adjectivally precede the nouns that they modify (Wakasa 2008:1044)

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|ló77-o dé7-uwa de7-áis.
|good-OBL life-ABS.M.SG live-{{gcl|IMPF|imperfect}}.1SG.
|"I live a good life."}}

Numerals precede the nouns that they quantify over (Wakasa 2008:1045)

{{interlinear|number=ex:
|na7-ái naa77-ú mácc-a 7as-atá be7-íis.
|child-NOM.M.SG two-OBL female-OBL people-ABS.PL see-{{gcl|PF|perfect}}.3M.SG.
|"The boy saw two women."}}
