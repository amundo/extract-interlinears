The verbalizing suffix ''-(n)a'' can be used to create verbs from nouns and adjectives, as in the case of the word for white, 'waia' (p.&nbsp;45):

=== Non-derivational affixes ===
The only class of non-derivational affixes in Maia are possessor prefixes. These prefixes are appended in front of an adjective to indicate the possessor of the noun, as summarized in the table below. The distinction between singularity and plurality is established with a difference in stress patterns.

-
''i-''
1st person singular
-
''ni-''
2nd person singular
-
''u-''
3rd person singular
-
''<nowiki/>' i-''
1st person plural
-
''<nowiki/>' ni-''
2nd person plural
-
''<nowiki/>' wi-''
3rd person plural

These prefixes indicate that an adjective "belongs" to the object being described. In the following example, the prefix ''u-''indicates that the quality of being short belongs to the tree (p.&nbsp;59).

=== Agreement ===
In transitive clauses, the verb must agree in both person and number with the object. In the following example, the verb for 'divide' must include the third-person-singular marker 'a' to indicate that it applies to a singular object in the third person (the pig):

==== Transitive Clauses ====
The basic word order of Maia is SOV for transitive clauses, as illustrated by the transitive sentence example below:

==== Intransitive Clauses ====
The basic word order is SV for intransitive clauses:

==== Ditransitive Clauses ====
For clauses that have both an indirect object and a direct object, the indirect object typically comes before the direct object. The following example, in which 'Kunia' is the indirect object and 'plate' is the direct object, illustrates this:

==== Verb + Object Phrase ====
The verb phrase in the example above illustrates that the verb + object phrase in Maia is head final, as the verb 'chase' comes after the object 'pig'.

==== Possessee + Possessor Phrase ====
The possessee+possessor phrase is also head final, as the possessee 'garden' comes after the possessor 'Mamudia':

==== Complementizer/Subordinator + Clause Phrase ====
An exception is the complementizer/subordinator+clause phrase, which is head-initial. In the example below, 'me maianane' translates to 'because'. This complementizer precedes the rest of the clause.

==== Adverbials ====
Adverbs are placed before the verb in adverbial phrases:

==== Adjectives ====
Adjectives are placed immediately after the noun that they describe:
