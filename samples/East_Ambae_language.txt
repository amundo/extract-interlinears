possessee-i possessor

Margaret's child
possessee classifier-i possessor


According to Hyslop (2001, p.&nbsp;167), while it is a morphosyntactic difference between direct and indirect possessive constructions, it is a semantically motivated distinction. In a direct possessive construction, nouns that function as the possessee can be said to be [[Inalienable possessioninalienably possessed]], which refers to a permanent and inherent connection between the possessor and possessee that is indissoluble. Indirect possessive construction refers to [[Inalienable possessionalienable possession]], a relationship between two referents of a less permanent and inherent type than inalienable possession, of an item that is to be 'possessed' in the conventional sense (Hyslop, 2001, p.&nbsp;176).
