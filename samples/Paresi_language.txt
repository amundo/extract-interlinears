=== Quantifiers ===
Paresi has the following quantifiers: ''tyotya'' 'all', ''kahare'' 'many, a lot', ''inira'' 'few', and ''taita'' 'only’. The first three can appear independently as pronouns, and all four modify nouns. ''Tyotya'', ''kahare'', and ''inira'' can appear both before and after nouns, whereas ''inira'' can only appear before nouns. Unlike demonstratives, these quantifiers can also take personal clitics and aspect markers, which are normally only found on verbs (Brandão, 2014).
