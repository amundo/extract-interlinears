==== Tense ====
Tense marking is always optional. The only explicitly marked tense is the future tense. Past and present tense cannot be marked and are always implied. All verbs can be marked through adverbs to show relative time (using words such as "yesterday" or "tomorrow"). If neither of these markings is present, the verb can imply a past, present, or future tense.

==== Switch-references ====
[[Switch-reference]]s occur in dependent clauses only with third person subjects. The verb must be marked as reflexive if the third person subject of the dependent clause matches the subject of the main clause (more specifically matrix clause).

!Notes
-

Kaakkama niġiŋaruq.
hungry-3-REFL-COND eat-3-IND
When he/she got hungry, he/she ate.
The verb in the matrix clause (to eat) refers to the same person because the verb in the dependent clause (To get hungry) is reflexive. Therefore, a single person got hungry and ate.
-

Kaaŋman niġiŋaruq.
hungry-3-NREFL-COND eat-3-IND
When he/she got hungry, (someone else) ate.
The verb in the matrix clause (to eat) refers to a different singular person because the verb in the dependent clause (To get hungry) is non-reflexive.
