Zero-derivation also takes place in Bilinarra, where nouns can be derived from coverbs. For example, ngurra can mean "to camp" or "camp" depending on the context.sfnMeakinsNordlinger2014p=156

2=that=TOP=1MIN-DU

3='I might just go back, then return the next day.'
Bilinarra has both "restricted" and "unrestricted" clitics. Of interest to note is the difference between restricted and unrestricted clitics. Unrestricted clitics can be attached to any part of speech. For example, =ma, TOPic, and =barla/warla, FOCus:sfnMeakinsNordlinger2014p=93

Wanyji-ga=warla=n ba-ni nyila girrawa?
2=which-LOC=FOC=2MIN.S hit-PST that goanna
3='Where did you kill that goanna?'
On the other hand, restricted clitics can only attach to certain parts of speech. The expectation modifier =rni, ONLY, can be attached to all words except inflecting verbs, and =rnigan, AGAIN, can only attach to nominals and coverbs:

3='Then I'll take plane again.'
