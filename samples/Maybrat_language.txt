There are four classifiers: ''-ana'' 'head' (a general classifier that is most commonly used for humans and animates), ''-akan'' 'seed/stone' (for seeds and fruit), ''m-ake'' 'fruit' (for fruit), and ''-ata'' 'leaf' (for money/banknotes). A similar use is made of the noun ''yu'' 'bag' when giving the quantity of uncountables:

pasa uuyu eok
rice uubag two
'two bags of rice' harvDol2007p=131

t-api

If expressed,  the subject precedes the verb, while an [[Object (grammar)object]] follows the verb. Thus, Maybrat has a rigid [[Subject–verb–objectSVO]] word order.

rae m-fat ara
person 3U-fell tree
(subject) (verb) (object)
'The people fell a tree.' harvDol2007p=144 
The object can also be omitted if it can easily be inferred from the context:

m-kai
3U-find
'She finds (something).' harvDol2007p=146 
An object can be given more [[Topicalisationprominence as a topic]] by [[Left dislocationmoving]] it to the start of the clause. The object then has an intonation contour of its own and it is separated from the rest of the clause by a pause:

aya fó / t-ata fe
water this / 1S-drink NEG
'This water, I won't drink it.' harvDol2007p=149 

is mti y-tien fe
yesterday night 3M-sleep NEG
'Last night he did not sleep.' harvDol2007p=151 
All other types of adverbials (for manner, location, etc.) follow the verb:

ait y-no rere u
3M 3M-do carefully again
'He carefully does it again.' harvDol2007p=163 

ait y-amo to-tis amah iye
3M 3M-go LOC-behind house too.
'He goes behind the house too.' harvDol2007p=166 

ait y-amo Kumurkek fe

'He does not go to Kumurkek.' harvDol2007p=167

Content questions feature a question word replacing whatever part of the clause information is being sought for:

'Who did Yul Yumte marry?' harvDol2007p=180

'She scoops water, burns a fire and cooks food.' harvDol2007p=190

t-sam t-aut ara
1S-afraid 1S-climb tree
'I'm afraid to climb the tree'. harvDol1996p=30 However, if a pause is inserted after ''t-sam'' 'I'm afraid', then the sentence will be interpreted as consisting in two clauses and its meaning will be 'I'm afraid and (so) I climb the tree.'

y-awe n-ame fane
3M-say 2-stab pig
'He says that you stabbed a pig.' harvDol2007p=198 If a pause is inserted after ''y-awe'' 'he says', then the second clause will be interpreted as direct speech: 'He says: "You stab a pig."'

Pak guru y-awe y-o pron
mister teacher 3M-say 3M-take bamboo
'The teacher wants to take the bamboo'. harvDol2007p=203 This is the same indirect speech construction as above. The verb ''-awe'' 'say' has a wide range of meanings that can be rendered in English with verbs like "want", "think", "believe" or "intend". This is common in Papuan languages. efnHowever, there do exist separate verbs meaning for example "think" (''-not''), or "hope" (''-winaut''). harvDol2007p=77  

t-ama uut-pat Sorong
1S-come uu1S-from Sorong
'I came from Sorong.' harvDol2007p=205 

t-amus onfuk uum-kah sabun
1S-wash clothes uu3U-with soap
'I wash the clothes with soap.' harvDol2007p=207 The prepositional verb ''-kah'' takes only the 3rd person unmarked prefix ''m-'' irrespective of the person of the subject.sfnDol2007p=80 
There is a cline between typical verbs on the one hand and typical prepositions on the other. The four "prepositional verbs" of Maybrat each fall on different points along this cline and possess different combinations of verbal or prepositional characteristics. One typically verbal characteristic is the ability to serve as the main verb of a clause: ''-ae'' 'at' alone among these four can function as the main verb of a clause. Another verbal characteristic is the ability to show agreement with the subject of the clause. In this respect, the two verbs ''-kit'' 'towards' and ''-pat'' 'from' are more verbal in that they always take person prefixes agreeing with the subject; this contrasts both with ''-kah'' 'with/to/for', which always takes only the unmarked third-person prefix ''m-'' regardless of the subject, and with ''-ae'', which may follow either pattern. These four verbs also differ in the extent to which their objects can be extracted into relative clauses.sfnDol2007p=209

t-ai bola m-amo
1S-throw ball 3U-go
'I throw the ball away.' harvDol2007p=217 

t-aru awiah m-ama
1S-pull taro 3U-come
'I pull the taro towards me.' harvDol1996p=25 
A similar construction involving the verbs ''-o'' 'take' and ''-e'' 'give' is available to express the meaning of 'giving something ''to someone'''; such a construction is necessary because verbs in Maybrat can only take two arguments (a subject and an object) and so ''-e'' 'give' on its own cannot take arguments for both the object given and the person who received it:

'When I go down to Sorong, I will send a letter' harvDol2007p=235 The moment of going to Sorong is non-specific, the implication of the use of ''kine wo'' is that there is no concrete plan yet.
